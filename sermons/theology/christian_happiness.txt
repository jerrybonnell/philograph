Reasonable beings while they act as such naturally choose those things which they are convinced are best for them and will certainly do those things which they know they had better do than leave undone And indeed who in the world could imagine that there were such unreasonable creatures in the world as that at the very same time that they themselves know a thing to be much to their advantage yet will not choose or do it God always deals with men as reasonable creatures and every word in the Scriptures speaks to us as such Whether it be in instructing and teaching of us he gives us no commands to believe those things which are directly contrary to reason and in commanding of us he desires us to do nothing but what will be for our own advantage our own profit and benefit and frequently uses this argument with us to persuade us to obey his commands For can a man be profitable to God as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself is it any pleasure to the Almighty that we are righteous or is it gain to him that we make our ways perfect Job 2223 But God has told us that if we be wise we shall be wise for ourselves and God in our text gives it as a special charge to assure the godly from Him that his godliness shall be of great advantage to him And that we may the better understand it and see how it is brought in let us look back on the foregoing words God in the beginning of this chapter denounced great and terrible judgments against the children of Judah as in the first and succeeding verses

For behold the Lord the Lord of hosts doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff the whole stay of bread and the whole stay of water and babes shall rule over them And the people shall be oppressed everyone by another and everyone by his neighbor the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient and the base against the honorable For Jerusalem is ruined and Judah is fallen Woe unto their soul for they have rewarded evil unto themselves Isaiah 31 Isaiah 345 Isaiah 389

But yet in the midst of all this however dreadful the judgments may be upon the generality of the people however woeful the case of the rest of them may be yet say unto the righteous assure him and cause him to know that it shall be well with him And here we may observe what a particular care and concern the Almighty seems to have about the righteous he suddenly stops and as it were breaks off abruptly the thread of the foregoing prophecy and gives the strictest charge go and tell the righteous that however the people should be oppressed however Jerusalem should be ruined and Judah should be fallen yet that he need not fear for it should be well with him Wherefore what we shall insist upon shall be this

Doctrine

A good man is a happy man whatever his outward circumstances are

By happy in the Doctrine is not meant what in the most strict sense it is taken for the actual enjoyment of the highest pleasure and perfection without the least mixture of the contrary for that is reserved for every godly person to be enjoyed only after this life but it is sufficient in our sense to make a man happy if his condition be very excellent desirable and joyful and we are now to show that the state of a good man is such whatever his outward circumstances are But we shall first observe which is our first proposition that

Prop I The outward or worldly circumstances of a good man are sometimes very afflictive God often sees cause to afflict his children for their good and we see no distinction made in this world in the administration of worldly good things between the good and the bad God causes his sun to shine and his rain to fall alike on the just and on the unjust Indeed in some respects the good man is most liable to worldly evils there are many godly men that enter into heaven through much tribulation and Christ tells those who are his disciples that they must expect no other than tribulation here and gives them the reason of it John 151819 tis because they are not of this world If they were of this world the world would love them but because they are not of this world they are exalted clear above the world and this spiteful and invidious world always hates and envies all that are above it so that as things sometimes stand the godly man may say that if there be no resurrection he is of all men the most miserable But

Prop II The good man is happy in whatsoever condition he is in and that

First because no worldly evils can do him any real hurt secondly because of those advantages spiritual joys and satisfactions he enjoys while here and thirdly more especially from the joyful hope and certain expectation of the enjoyment of the perfection of happiness eternally hereafter But

First Because no worldly evils can do him any real hurt The good man is exalted out of the reach of all worldly evils they cannot send forth their baneful influences so high as to touch him and all the hurt they can do him is but as a sharp medicine Although it be bitter yet it takes away those diseases that would in the end if they were let alone be a thousand times more painful and troublesome to him A good man may look down upon all the whole army of worldly afflictions under his feet with a slight and disregard that is as evils for he ought to have the greatest regard to them as they are for his good and consider with himself and joy therein that however great they are and however numerous let them all join their forces together against him and put on their most rueful and dreadful habits forms and appearances and spend all their strength vigor and violence with endeavors to do him any real hurt or mischief and it is all in vain He may triumph over them all knowing this light afflictions which are but for a moment shall only work out for him a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory and that although sorrow continue for a night yet joy cometh in the morning remembering Gods promise that all things shall surely work together for his good and nothing shall offend If he loses all the worldly good things he has his estate friends and relations or if his body is put to the greatest tortures and pains imaginable he may consider that it is all best for him that it should be and that all the hurt they can do him is only to his body And our Savior has commanded us not to fear them that even kill the body and after that have no more that they can do and whatever the world does against him he has that to comfort him that Christ has overcome the world

How happy then must the condition of such a man be Let any man now ask himself whether he should not think himself happy if he were delivered so from all those evils that he was assured they would never trouble him more if he were sure that he should never feel any more pain in his body never have any want of any good things the world can afford and never have any care and trouble about them well then is it not all one as if they never happened to him if when they do happen to him they do him no hurt Yea is it not more than equivalent if when they happen they not only do him hurt but good But this is the condition of a good man and although good men are often grieved and troubled by worldly afflictions and indeed they ought to be grieved for their sins for the purging away of which their afflictions come yet the godly has no occasion to be troubled any further about them Matthew 534 Matthew 51012

Second The godly man is happy in whatever circumstances he is placed because of the spiritual privileges and advantages joys and satisfactions he actually enjoys while in this life How great a happiness must needs it be to a man to have all his sins pardoned and to stand guilty of nothing in Gods presence to be washed clean from all his pollutions to have the great and eternal and almighty Jehovah who rules and governs the whole universe and doth whatsoever he pleases in the armies of heaven and amongst the inhabitants of the earth reconciled to him and perfectly at peace with him How great a pleasure and satisfaction must it be to him to think of it and not only that God is reconciled to him or has nothing against him inasmuch as all is pardoned but also that this same almighty being who created him who keeps him in being and who disposes of him and all other things every moment loves him and that with a great and transcendent love and that He has adopted him and taken him to be His child and given Himself to him to be his father and his portion and that takes care of him as one that is very dear to Him continually guides and directs him and will lead him to the fountain of living waters And how joyful and gladsome must the thoughts of Jesus Christ be to him to think with how great a love Christ has loved him even to lay down His life and suffer the most bitter torments for his sake Who also now continually intercedes for him at the throne of grace to consider that so great a person as the eternal Son of God who also made the worlds is his lord and master and is not ashamed to call us brethren Who will come in and sup with him and He with him and to see His arms expanded to embrace him and offering Himself to be embraced by him And beside what a satisfaction and pleasure must it give to his mind to think that he is now sanctified and made holy adorned and beautified with those lovely graces that make him lovely in the sight of God and excellent in the sight of saints and angels to reflect on himself and consider that he acts rationally and doth that which the best of beings has commanded that he in some measure acts worthy of the nature of a man in some measure answers the end of his coming into the world in glorifying God and doing good to his fellow creatures and that he has not lived altogether in vain not as it is with many they live in the world and burthen the same and had better be dead than alive for all the good they do in it or any they do towards manifesting the glory of him that made them The reflection on these things affords such a peace and pleasantness to the mind as far exceeds and is immensely above all outward delights What there is no wicked man doth know neither neither hath it entered into their hearts to conceive how great are the comforts and pleasures of the godly and how great the things God hath prepared for all those that love him even in this life their pleasures are of vastly a more refined higher and more noble kind than those of the wicked besides the many other advantages that this has above that but especially that taken notice of in the Doctrine that no worldly afflictions in the world are able to deprive them of them but they as rightly improved do only serve to give them a quicker and more lively sense of spiritual enjoyments But the time would fail to stay to enumerate all the happinesses of a good man even in this life I shall therefore pass to the next particular

Third And lastly from the joyful hope and assured expectation of the enjoyment of the completion of happiness eternally hereafter to pretend to describe the excellence the greatness or duration of the happiness of heaven by the most artful composition of words would be but to darken and cloud it To talk of raptures and ecstasies joy and singing is but to set forth by very low shadows of the reality and all we can say by our best rhetoric is really and truly vastly below what is but the bare and naked truth and if St Paul who had seen them thought it but in vain to endeavor to utter it much less shall we pretend to do it and the Scriptures have gone as high in the descriptions of it as we are able to keep pace with in our imaginations and conception We shall only say this that the good man has the assurance and certainty of this that he shall at last surely enjoy such a happiness as the Scripture describes to us He has the best testimony and the strongest security of it he has a wellgrounded hope that what he loves now above all things he shall then enjoy to the full of his desires and whatsoever little beginnings of pleasure he feels now he is assured shall bestow the highest perfection without the least mixture of the contrary And now I leave it to every particular mans consideration how great the happiness is in the actual enjoyment and how great in the expectation of it and with this consideration the grounds of the hope of this happiness cant be in the least lessened by the greatest worldly afflictions And now I hope I have sufficiently cleared it up the godly man is happy in whatsoever worldly circumstances he is placed
