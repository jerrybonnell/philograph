Tis very probable that Solomon wrote these Proverbs more especially for the use of his children and particularly of his son that was to be the heir of the kingdom and of the chief of his riches and honors to give him wisdom that he might be prudent and righteous in all his life And therefore he so frequently says in this book My son do thus or Thus my son hear the instruction of thy father My son forget not my law and the like And so in our text My son eat thou honey because it is good and the honeycomb which is sweet to thy taste so shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul when thou hast found it then there shall be a reward and thy expectation shall not be cut off

Or second he says My son because in teaching these Proverbs he does the part of a father to all those who will be instructed by him to every reader or hearer of them because it appertains to fathers more especially to instruct their children and tell them how they shall live and act He does the part of a tutor to children in writing of these excellent instructions He is in the room of a father to us and we who receive instruction from him are in the room of childrenAmong the Edwards Family Papers in the Beinecke and Trask libraries are scraps of childrens writing exercises that include quotes from Proverbs

Or third because he speaks by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost and in the name of God who is our heavenly Father And so God is dealing with us as with children in giving of us those blessed instructions and so says according to his goodness My son that he may thereby draw us to hearken to him

And here we are argued with from our own actions and God makes use of what we ourselves grant and the principles we in ordinary things act according to Eat thou honey because it is good that is you do eat honey because it is good So shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul when thou hast found it then there shall be a reward and thy expectation shall not be cut off

We may take notice in the words of

1 The drift and design of the wise man in these words that is to exhort us to seek wisdom Wisdom in the book of Proverbs for the most part is put either for Jesus Christ the Word the power and wisdom of God as in the eighth chapter and other places or for grace and spiritual wisdom taking in also a moral prudence a measure of which is always given to those who have true grace Both these may be resolved into the same for true wisdom and grace in the heart is nothing else but Christ dwelling in the wise the Spirit of Christ in the godly for they are the temples of Jesus So in which sense soever we shall take it in these words it comes to the same thing for if by wisdom we understand Christ then the meaning is that Christ is pleasant to the soul when we find him and get an interest in him or if we understand it of grace in the heart that grace is sweet and raises pleasure when we obtain it Grace is obtained at the same moment that Christ is obtained and the sweetness of grace is little different from the pleasantness of Jesus Christ

2 Observe the argument that is made use of to persuade us to seek wisdom that is the pleasantness of it

3 The comparison here made use of to enforce this argument upon us that is the eating of honey for the sake of its sweetness Eat thou honey because it is good and the honeycomb which is sweet to thy taste We are not to take this as a command but a concession that is you do eat honey for the sake of the sweetness of it And there is the same reason why you should seek wisdom and get grace for however that may seem an insipid thing to you before you have tried it yet when you have found it you will find it to be as sweet as honey to you So shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul when thou hast found it then there shall be a reward and thy expectation shall not be cut off Religion is worthy of our choice and practice for the sake of those comforts and delights that are experienced therein

Doctrine
It would be worth the while to be religious if it were only for the pleasantness of it
You will eat honey says Solomon only for the pleasantness of it and because it is sweet to your taste And there is the same reason it is well worth your while to seek wisdom and grace for this is as sweet as honey when you have found it

This I hope to clear up beyond contradiction and demonstrate beyond objection by five reasons

I Religion does not deny a man the pleasures of sense only taken moderately and with temperance and a right manner

II Religion sweetens temporal delights and pleasures

III Because there is no pleasure but what brings more of sorrow than of pleasure but what the religious man either does or may enjoy

IV Religion brings no new trouble upon a man but what brings more of pleasure than of trouble

V The religious man enjoys spiritual pleasures that are much better and sweeter than any others

If all these are true certain I am that it cannot be denied that there is much the most delight in a religious life and that tis as we say therefore worth the while to be religious if it were only for the delight and pleasantness of it

I Religion does not deny a man the pleasures of sense only taken moderately and with temperance and in a reasonable manner God has given us of his redundant bounty many things for the delight of our senses for our pleasure and gratification Religion is not a thing that makes these things useless to us does not cut us off from the enjoyment of them The sensual man cannot boast of the enjoyment of any kind of gratifications but what the religious man may enjoy as well as he There are none of the senses but God allows of the gratification of yea he has made much provision for their gratification Religion allows us to take the full comfort of our meat and drink all reasonable pleasures that are to be enjoyed in conversation or recreation allows of the gratification of all our natural appetites under the governance of reason And there are none of the five senses but what we are allowed to please and gratify

Indeed religion does forbid the wicked mans unreasonable and brutish manner of enjoying sensitive pleasure which a godly man does not desire and no reasonable man would choose Religion teaches us to use temporal comforts like men and not like brutes like reasonable creatures and not as if we had nothing else but sense and no understanding

Religion allows of the enjoyment of sensitive delights temperately moderately and with reason but the wicked man gluts himself with them Any of the delights of this world are abundantly sweeter when taken temperately than when taken immoderately as he that at a feast feeds with temperance has much greater pleasure of what he eats and drinks than he that gluts himself and vomits it up again The godly have the prudence to take of earthly delights moderately but the wicked man he is unreasonable in it by being so greedy and violent he presently loses the relish of his pleasure but the godly takes those things so that the sweet relish of them remains all his lifetimeThe original composition reads but the godly take it so that the swe those y think so that the sweet relish of them remains all his lifetime Proverbs 2516 Hast thou found honey eat so much as is sufficient for thee lest thou be filled therewith and vomit it The righteous man has the prudence to eat no more honey than he can digest and that the relish of it may remain

II Religion sweetens temporal delights and pleasures Religion does not only allow us to enjoy temporal comforts but adds a new sweetness to them beyond what wicked and sensual men can find in them When the wicked man pursues sensual delights in a wicked manner he doth it against his reason and conscience his flesh drives him on against his mind his understanding consents not but opposes him in it So that he enjoys his pleasures with war with himself his own reason and conscience opposing him which takes away the sweetness of the pleasure and his body only is partaker of the pleasure and not his mind He enjoys pleasures but there is a sting in them and conscience roars the while and will not give him peace His own reason will not let him alone to enjoy them peaceably

But the godly taking those delights according to reason and conscience his internal man consents to his external in the enjoyment of them and partakes with him therein and it is a pleasant feast that the body and soul enjoy together His reason the highest faculty of the man gives him leave and his conscience commends him in it and there is no such perplexing disturbance in his breast as the wicked have but all is done with peace and without the sting of conscience The reasonable creature never feels better and more easy than when he acts reasonably and like according to the nature of a man and like consistent with himself

And as we have already said the temporal delights of the Christian are much sweeter than the earthly pleasures of the wicked because they are taken with moderation so also because they are taken in their own season and in other respects right manner Everything is most beautiful and most pleasant in its season Snow is not beautiful in summer or rain in harvest Ecclesiastes 311 He hath made everything beautiful in his time

The Christian partakes of the comforts of this life with an honest mind and with singleness of heart Those things that are enjoyed with an honest mind are much sweeter and pleasanter than the enjoyments of a wicked heart We read in the second chapter of Acts at the last verse that the primitive Christians did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart Proverbs 168 Better is a little with righteousness than great revenues without rightThe last three words of the quote are in shorthand

The wicked man though he has the pleasures of this life yet he partakes of them with fear He lives in a slavish fear all his days of death and hell He eats and drinks with fear in fear and this takes away much of the delight of what he enjoys Though a man be rich and fares sumptuously yet if he eats and drinks in fear of his life this takes away all the comfort of his riches If one lives in the enjoyment of many good things yet if he lives so that he is exposed to an enemy continually a man that dwells in a cottage lives better than he Feed a malefactor condemned to the gallows with the richest fare he will not have so much comfort of it as one that eats only bread and water without fear The wicked man he takes these things as a thief that is afraid of the shaking of a leaf Proverbs 281 The wicked fleeth when no man pursueth Also Job 2417 But the Christian he partakes of his delights in safety and without fear can eat and drink without terrors with boldness and confidence

The earthly comforts of the Christian are also very much sweetened by the consideration of the love of God that God is their Father and friend and gives them these blessings from love to them and because he delights in them But the wicked can have no assurance that his enjoyments are not given to him in anger and in judgment

The temporal delights of the godly are also very much sweetened because they are enjoyed in love and peace He eats and drinks in love to God and Jesus Christ and in peace with his neighbors and charity towards the whole world Proverbs 1517 Better is a dinner of herbs where love is than a stalled ox and hatred therewith and Proverbs 171 Better is a dry morsel and quietness than a house full of sacrifices with strife Ecclesiastes 46 Better is an handful with quietness than both the hands full with travail and vexation of spirit

III There is no pleasure but what brings more of sorrow than of pleasure but what the godly man either does or may enjoy The sinful unreasonable and beastly pleasures of the wicked they bring more of sorrow with them The wicked may feel some pleasure for a moment it turns to sorrow and bitterness in a little time And then even in this life it is but a little pleasure that is enjoyed in the time of it and that is speedily over and turns to bitterness in the reflection and makes such a disorder in the mind and uproar in the soul that the lasting uneasiness far more than compensates the shortlived pleasure

All the pleasures of sin for the most part do bring more of sorrow than of pleasure in this life whether the pleasures of sloth of luxury or drunkenness or rioting or fornication If these things were let alone a mans life in the general would be much more pleasant to him They bring a great deal of trouble on their minds and quite destroy all peace there by fear or accusation of conscience or shame and disgrace in the world the ruin of their children and the like and also upon their bodiessensuality being a spring of all manner of diseasesand the ruin of their estates And many other ways do vices ruin the comfort of a mans life And it is only those pleasures that do so that religion forbids Proverbs 2332 At last it will bite like a serpent and sting like an adder

IV Religion brings no new troubles upon man but what have more of pleasure than of trouble There is repentance of sin though it be a deep sorrow for sin that God requires as necessary to salvation yet the very nature of it necessarily implies delight Repentance of sin is a sorrow arising from the sight of Gods excellency and mercy but the apprehension of excellency or mercy must necessarily and unavoidably beget pleasure in the mind of the beholder Tis impossible that anyone should see anything that appears to him excellent and not behold it with pleasure and its impossible to be affected with the mercy and love of God and his willingness to be merciful to us and love us and not be affected with pleasure at the thoughts of it but this is the very affection that begets true repentance How much soever of a paradox it may seem it is true that repentance is a sweet sorrow so that the more of this sorrow the more pleasure

Especially do great delights ensue and follow it Repentance it clears up the mind and makes it easy and serene and brings the good of comfort into the soulLater addition It is the wind that drives away clouds makes a clear heaven and lets the beams of comfort descend

There is selfdenial will also be reckoned amongst the troubles of the godly and their laboriousness and diligence in their Christian course and mortification in their warfare But whoever has tried selfdenial can give in his testimony that they never experience greater pleasures and joys than after great acts of selfdenial Selfdenial destroys the very root and foundation of sorrow and is nothing else but the lancing of a grievous and painful sore that effects a cure and brings abundance of health as a recompense for the pain of the operation

Reproaches and the malice and envy of the wicked may also be reckoned as some of the chief troubles of the godly But the true Christian is of such a magnanimous mind that he ordinarily can contemn this and return into the arms of Jesus his best friend with the more delight The world hates them but they can be of good cheer because Christ has overcome the world And although they themselves dont perceive in the time how those reproaches conduce to their comfort afterwards yet God in his wise providence brings it about for their joy and greater enlightening Reproaches are ordered by God for this end that they may destroy sin which is the chief root of the troubles of the godly man and the destruction of it a foundation for delight And when the godly patiently bear them God commonly requites for their reproaches 2 Samuel 1612 It may be the Lord will look on mine affliction and that the Lord will requite me good for his cursing this day

And so the other persecutions that Christians may meet with from the wicked See what Christ commands concerning revilings and persecutions Matthew 51112 Blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake Rejoice and be exceeding glad And James 12 My brethren count it all joy when ye fall into diverse temptations And we find that the apostles acted accordingly Acts 541 And they departed from the presence of the council rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name And this was the practice of other Christians in those times Hebrews 1034 Ye took joyfully the spoiling of your gods

V The fifth reason why it would be worth the while to be religious if it were only for the pleasantness of it is that the religious man enjoys spiritual pleasures that are much better than any others That which is most noble and excellent in man and that whereby he is most exalted in his nature and most distinguished from the inferior creatures is undoubtedly capable of the best delights and most excellent and refined pleasures But that in man which is spiritual and intellectual is of a far more excellent nature than that which is merely animal It will therefore follow that spiritual and intellectual pleasures are far more eligible than those that are earthly But the wicked man by devoting himself to sense cuts himself from all those and for the sake of those pleasures that he enjoys in common with him to the beasts that perish secludes himself from those that he might enjoy in common with the angels and heavenly spirits in common with the man Christ Jesus yea in common with the great God himself He has pleasures of mind as well as pleasure of body The wicked man cuts himself off from all pleasures in his noble and more excellent part even his soul We must needs conclude that the pleasures of the soul are far better than of the body for that that is most excellent and has the highest faculties must needs be capable of the greatest delights and most excellent gratifications

First Religion sets all to rights in the soul and regulates its faculties and operations according to their genuine and most natural order Sin confounds all in the mind and puts everything into confusion and uproar Reason is set lowest and lust and passion placed in the throne and sense is placed in the seat of understanding And whilst reason is trampled under foot and the eye of the soul being put out the will is hurried to and fro by ungoverned governing and raging appetites and there is nothing but war and turmoils in the mind But religion composes all and places everything in its natural order whence follows serenity peace and tranquility and the health and happiness of the mind Religion sets all to rights in the soul so that there is no opposition between one faculty and another Wickedness disorders the mind and casts things over of their most natural and excellent order which must needs cause trouble and uneasiness But religion places all in its true and natural order When things are in their natural order they are at rest and quiet and there is no disturbance so religion causes a calmness and quietness in the mind The wicked mans passions are always at war with his reason his inclination with his light and understanding but in the religious man all the powers are of one consent and there is peace among them and they all concur in the same thing

Second Tis a great pleasure for an intelligent and rational being to be excellent Happiness and delight of soul arise always from the sight or apprehension of something that appears excellent Thus even God himself has infinite delight in beholding his own infinite excellency and for an excellent being there necessarily arises pleasure Not the godly are pleased with proud and haughty thoughts of their own excellency for they know they have nothing but what they received and that their excellency is wholly communicated to them by God But the believer may rejoice and does rejoice to see the image of God upon their souls to see the likeness of his dear Jesus The saints in heaven who have all remainders of pride taken away do yet rejoice to see themselves made excellent by God and appearing beautiful with holiness And if it be a great pleasure to see excellent things it must be a sweet consideration to think that God of his grace has made me excellent and lovely If they delight to see the loveliness of Jesus Christ it must needs be matter of delight to see that Christ has communicated of his loveliness to their souls

Third The pleasures of doing well are very sweet to the godly We must take heed that we do not confound the pleasure of the proud man who is lifted up because he thinks he of his own ability does better than others and of the Christian who rejoices in the grace of God that enables him to obey him and do good works Tis essential to a Christian that it be his delight and pleasure to obey God and do well The wicked loves to act basely but the Christian loves to act rationally and excellently Tis their delight to imitate God and live like Jesus and act like a rational creature

Fourth The Christian enjoys the pleasure of the most excellent knowledge Tis natural to the reasonable creature to love knowledge of one kind or other and to delight in the attainment of knowledge Some seek the knowledge of earthly things and some of heavenly but the believer has the most excellent kind of knowledge he has the pleasure of knowing the most glorious truths the most excellent verities What a delight do some men take in human learning how much greater delight does the Christian take in divine Great part of the happiness of the angels and saints in heaven is their knowledge their understandings are enlarged and their knowledge we may conclude is immensely larger than of the wisest men in this world

Fifth There is very great delight the Christian enjoys in the sight he has of the glory and excellency of God How many arts and contrivances have men to delight the eye of the body Men take delight in the beholding of great cities splendid buildings and stately palaces And what delight is often taken in the beholding of a beautiful face May we not well conclude that great delights may also be taken in pleasing the eye of the mind in seeing the most beautiful the most glorious the most wonderful Being in the world What pleasure do some take in contemplating the beauty and proportions of the world the work of Gods hands How much greater may we conclude is to be therein beheld

Sixth The godly man takes unspeakable delight in thinking that God the governor of the world and the most excellent Being loves him and is his friend What delight do men take sometimes in the love of their fellow creatures that they think em excellent And can we be so foolish as to think that there is any comparison between this and the delight that the godly take in thinking that God is their friend yea that he loves them with a very great love has given himself to them and the like When he lifts up his eyes to heaven and is amazed at that wonderful power of God that created and ordained the sun moon and stars he may have the satisfaction to think that the great Author of all these things is his friend When he considers the curious frame and make of the creationwhether he with admiration views the harmonious order of the heavenly bodies the beautiful diposition of things on the face of the earth or the handy workmanship of mans bodyhe still has the satisfaction to think that this wise Artificer is his friend and with all his wisdom engaged for his good and happiness The same consideration must be equally pleasant to him when he considers Gods providence that he is the supreme governor of the world and disposes of all persons and things in it as he pleases When he reacts with things adverse or enemies amongst men he has this to solace him and when he considers Gods awful dealings with sinners or the dreadful overthrow of them sometimes in this world or their everlasting destruction in the future he may consider that God is tender gracious and full of love to him And when he reflects on the infinite riches of his grace declared in the gospel and bestowed in the heavenly world he may think that God has so great love to him as to will him all happiness that his infinite treasures afford and his nature can receive

Seventh Tis most sweet to the godly to behold the beauty and enjoy the love of Christ the Mediator He appears the most beautiful to them of anything in the world he is to them as the rose and lily as a bundle of myrrh his love is a sweet fragrancy None can tell the power of that joy that they feel from the consideration that so lovely a person loves them so as to lay down his life for them

Eighth What heightens and advances the Pleasure of society is the excellency and the love of those with whom we converse But the saints are the excellent of the earth they are possessed of excellency of the highest kind and they only are endowed with true excellency Proverbs 126 The righteous is more excellent than his neighbor and Proverbs 1727 A man of understanding is of an excellent spirit And certainly in such conversation is the greatest delight to be found Psalms 1623 My goodness extendeth not to thee but to the saints that are in the earth and to the excellent in whom is all my delight

And as religion makes lovely so it begets love the purest and most ardent Nothing so much tends to charity peace mutual benevolence and bounty as Christianity and therefore nothing so much sweetens human society Religion helps a man to enjoy much more pleasure in the society and conversation of men It begets love and peace good will one towards another brotherly kindness mutual benevolence bounty and a feeling of each others welfare And this sweetens their conversation and fellowship makes men to delight in each other

Ninth There are the great pleasures of hope of glory of a resurrection of an enjoyment of Christ forever These are pleasures too big to be expressed The righteous may meditate what glory what happiness they can desire and may be assured at the same time that they shall enjoy it all and abundantly more

Against this particular it may be objected that these refer to the pleasures of another life whereas the doctrine speaks of the pleasures of religion in this life I answer although the things hoped for are in another life yet the pleasure of the hope of them is enjoyed in this life

Thus I have gone through those five particulars by which I proposed to prove the doctrine and believe none will deny but that tis most certain that if religion does not deny us pleasures of sense taken with temperance but rather sweetens them and if it denies no pleasures at all but those that have more of sorrow than of pleasure and brings no new sorrow but what has more of pleasure than of sorrow and besides gives spiritual delights that are better than all others I think it cannot be questioned in any measure but that tis well worth the while to be religious if it were only for the pleasantness of it

Use

Use I Hence we learn that seeing it is so that tis worth the while to be religious if it were only for the delight and pleasantness of it then hence we may learn that sinners are left without any manner of objection against religion They cannot object against the excellency of religion nor profitableness of it Their last objection that they commonly fly to is the unpleasantness of it And I am satisfied if there be any person in this congregation that does not determine immediately after God that this is the objection that he makes the unpleasantness of being religious and seeking God the contrariety to his own inclinations the opposition to the bent of his heart But this objection we have fully answered Can any deny but that the doctrine must needs be true and has been evidenced so to be from the proofs that have been brought for it If you object that you must deny yourself pleasures of sense we have shown that religion does not deny us outward delights and pleasures yea that it sweetens temporal delights and pleasures We have shown that there is no pleasure but what brings more of sorrow that religion denies but what the godly man does or may enjoy You cannot object the troubles that you must meet with in a religious course of life as the troubles of a religious life bring no new troubles but what bring more of pleasure than of trouble We have also told what great spiritual pleasures the godly meet with besides and they must needs be great Tis impossible but that pleasures of that kind should be exceeding great for it is necessary in nature that spiritual pleasures when enjoyed should be the greatest to a spirit Tis so in all cases the things that are most becoming the nature of the soul will certainly cause the greatest pleasure in it I know tis impossible to convince men of this spiritual pleasure But however this may be they may consider that by this doctrine they will be left without excuse before God

Use II Second then we come with double forces against the wicked to persuade them to a godly life The most common argument that is used to urge men to godliness is the pleasures of the life to come but this has not its effect for the sinner who is in pursuit of the pleasures of this life Now therefore we urge to you the pleasures of this life therefore you can have nothing to say The common argument is the profitableness of religion but alas the wicked man is not in pursuit of profit tis pleasure he seeks Now then we will fight with them with their own weapons for religion does not deny us outward delights and pleasures

Use III If it be so that tis worth the while to be religious if it were only for the pleasantness of it then how exceeding great is the reward of the godly What a reward have they in the world to come what joys in another life But yet this is not all no they have a reward in this life In the very keeping of Gods commands there is great reward Psalms 1911 The reward they have in hand besides that which is promised is well worth all the pains they take all the troubles they endure God has not only promised them a great reward and exceeding great beyond conception but he has given them a foretaste in this world And this taste is better than all the pleasures and riches of the wicked

Psalms 11914 I have rejoiced in the way of thy commandments as much as in all riches Psalms 8410 A day in thy courts is better than a thousand elsewhere The Christian spends every day as it were in the courts of God The very pledge that God has given to the godly as an earnest of the reward is such that its well worth the while to deny all the pleasures of sin and to take all the troubles of religion for it Revelation 217 To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it What pure delights have the godly in this life How great then is the reward of the righteous if they have such a great reward in the life to come and so great a reward in this life into the bargain

But it may be objected Did not the Apostle say 1 Corinthians 1519 If in this life only we have hope in Christ we are of all men most miserable But I answer the Christian has hope in another life even while in this life Indeed if he expected to be turned to nothing when he died and that he should never after enjoy God whom he so earnestly loved nor enjoy Christ which he so exceedingly desired it would be such a dreadful consideration that together with his persecutions and troubles would quite sink his heart and render him most miserable But the Christian has the pleasure and joy of hope in this life and this made the Apostle even in this life though sorrowful yet always rejoicing 2 Corinthians 610

Use IV Of Trial Is it so that tis worth the while to be religious if only for the pleasure of it Then from this we may have an excellent characteristic of a godly man It is briefly thus every man that is convinced by his own experience what he has found of the pleasantness of religion that tis well worth the while to be religious if it were only for the sake of the sweetness of religion Is religion so sweet to him If so he may conclude that tis he has tasted the real sweetness of it

Appendix to Proverbs 241314

Hypocrites and mere pretenders to religion do not prize religion for the sake of anything that is in religion itself any of its excellent properties or sweetness they prize it upon some forensic considerations Some will prize religion because it gets them a name and honor amongst Gods people that they may be esteemed eminent saints and the children of God and peculiar favorites of heaven The people of God those who are really so do very highly honor and esteem one that they think is one that belongs to Jesus Christ They will delight to be in their society to prefer them above themselves and to speak to their honor And this is the reward of hypocrites which they delight in and is the very highest end that is aimed at by them in their seemingly religious behavior

Tis exceedingly gratifying to the nature of fallen man to be thought excellent and honorable and to be set above others to sit in the chief places in the synagogues and to be counted more righteous than others And for this end they are willing to be at the cost of a religious face and the form of godliness and of a partial selfdenial Thus did the Pharisees very great were their mortifications as we are acquainted in the Scriptures concerning them Luke 1812 I fast twice a week

So we have other accounts of them that tell us more of their austerities that they used to bear the weight of a talent upon their heads that they put thorns at the bottom of their robes that they might prick their legs as they went along that they lay upon boards with flint stone and tied thick cords about their wastes

These mortifications they underwent for the sake of the honor applause and veneration of the Jews Luke 2046 Beware of the scribes which desire to walk in long robes and love greetings in the markets and the highest seats in the synagogues and the chief rooms at feasts

So they take oftentimes a great deal of pleasure in thinking with themselves how much better they are than others how much more eminent and more loved by God Luke 1811 I am not as other men extortioners unjust adulterers nor as this publican

But those do not prize religion for the sake of itself because of any delight they have in the commandments of God or pleasure they experience in godliness that causes religion in their esteem to be preferable to any other kind of living anything that they experience that convinces them that tis well worth the while to be religious if it were only for the sake of religion itself and the sweetness of it although they think it worth the while to seek the form of godliness for the sake of the opinion and honors of men John 544 How can ye believe who receive honors one of another

Or they prize religion because they take pleasure in the proud thoughts they have of themselves for proud man loves to compare himself with others and the more he doth so the more he esteems himself whereas the sincere Christian is contrary the more he compares himself with others the less he appears to himself This sort of men indeed cannot properly be said to prize religion at all it is not religion that they prize or taste any sweetness in Tis the honor of men that they prize and their own thought of themselves is what they taste sweetness in and foolishly mistake and think they taste sweetness in religion and that they do really experience the true pleasures of godliness

There is yet another sort of men that are not altogether the same with this who perform some moral duties and abstain from gross transgression only or mostly through fear who yet cannot be said to prize religion but will rather do something of that which they have an aversion to to still their conscience and make themselves easy from slavish fear of hell Whereas if hell were but taken out of the way they would immediately quit morality and even external virtues for they are far from being convinced by experience that tis worth the while to be religious for the pleasure and delightsomeness of it

Neither can any sort of men be found that are not the real servants of God who is experimentally convinced of this truth But the godly he has that reward in hand those pleasures which he doth already enjoy the hidden manna that he feeds on on this side Canaan that he would not be without upon any worldly consideration whatever

We cannot determine that there are no Christians that have really the seeds of grace sown in their soul who yet by reason of spiritual desertion and darkness may have the rays of heaven so intercepted that they may go mourning and not have much of spiritual joy who cannot speak so freely to their experience of the truth of this doctrine But in the general Christians can say they have that pleasure and delight in godliness that they should choose before another kind of life for the sake of its pleasantness

But however all that do find this may conclude safely that what is so sweet and pleasant to them is real religion and true genuine godliness

Inf IV Is it so that it would be well worth the while to be religious if it were only for the pleasantness Then how much more joyfully and pleasantly might a people or society dwell together if they were generally truly religious If religion be very sweet alone it is more joyful in society Communion and mutual communications of pleasure do increase it even as the heat increases by laying coals to coals Proverbs 2717

Iron sharpeneth iron so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend So a Christian people really so or a society of real Christians do sharpen the countenances of each other adding new gladness to each others hearts and a new cheerfulness to their countenances

O how blessed and happy would it be to dwell among such a people Tis an image of heaven a people that live in righteousness and peace one with another in the fear of God in the love of the Lord Jesus Happiness may well be expected amongst them and we may well long for such a happiness

It not only advances the interest of their souls and invites God down in the midst of them but causes their wealth their honor their reputation and their comfort every way to be increased When we think of it we can long for it and pray for it and say Happy is that people that is in such a case but where alas where shall we find it

O the folly of the children of men It is their fault that it is not so Yea if it be not so in this very town it will be our fault Let every one do his part and this place will be thus happy and we the inhabitants of the same might enjoy this pleasure Let every one of us take care for one another and it will follow that all in the general will be likewise Yea and those whom God has called likewise have compassion on the souls of their neighbors and cease not to be importunate with God for them and incessant in their own endeavors every one according to his opportunity and according to his place and station

Inf V What reason then have Christians to disregard other delights and pleasures Are those so much preferable unto them
