These words are occasioned by the pride ignorance and unbelief of Peter one of the chiefif not the very chiefof the disciples whom Christ honored by making of him the rock upon which he would build his church and making of him a chief defense of the samethat is the chief amongst men for although the church was built on the foundation of the prophets and apostles yet Christ himself is the chief cornerstonewhom Christ had also honored by giving him the keys of the kingdom of heaven in a more especial manner The way wherein St Peter manifested that corruption which dwelt in him was this our Lord as it is said in the twentyfirst verse told his disciples perhaps more plainly than ever before how he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders chief priests and scribes and at last be killed which was very surprising to Peter who it seems had been carried away hitherto with that common error of the Jews that expected when the Messiah came that he would reign in abundance of worldly pomp and glory And therefore the news of the sufferings and death of him who he believed to be the Messiah and the Son of God as in the sixteenth verse was very unexpected and very much contradicted the notion he had received and his ambitious expectation of being the chief man next to Christ himself in his earthly kingdom because Christ had told him he should be the rock on which he would build his church and that he would give him the keys of his kingdom Wherefore Peter being so much moved by the vain desire of earthly prosperity ignorance of the nature of Christs kingdom and the great unbelief of what his Lord had told him rebukes him and says Be it far from thee Lord this thing shall not be unto thee which brought a very severe reproof from Christ as in the twentythird verse Get thee behind me Satan thou art an offense unto me for thou savorest not of those things that be of God but those that be of men That is as much as if he had said Thy heart is not set enough on heavenly and spiritual happiness honor and glory which is of God but too much on worldly honor pomp and applause which is of men and took occasion to tell his disciples plainly that if they would be of his kingdom they must not expect worldly good things but they must deny themselves and take up their cross and bear that and if they expected to live in his kingdom they must be ready to lay down their lives for his sake as in the twentyfourth and twentyfifth verses Then said Jesus unto his disciples If any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me For whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it And to explain the matter a little more to them and that this news might not be damping and discouraging to them he tells them in the verse of our text that the salvation of the soul was far more to be valued than all those worldly pomps and glories which they expected yea if it were the whole world it would be nothing in comparison of the life of the soul neither would it profit a man if the soul was lost for what is a man profited if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul and what shall a man give in exchange for his soul

In the words may be observed first the things that are compared and they are the whole world and the soul of man The comparison is between the whole world and the soul of one man all the riches all the silver and gold all the honors and glories pomp and pleasures of the same and that thinking being that is contained in the body of every living man Secondly there is the third thing they are compared in and that is profit value or worth Thirdly the determination or result of the comparison very strongly implied in those two interrogations what shall it profit a man and what shall he give in exchange The determination is made on the side of the soul insomuch that the whole world is looked upon as good for nothing in comparison of it a determination of it quite contrary to the general opinion of the men of this world which they abundantly manifest by their taking so much more care for but a very little part of the world than they do for the salvation of their own souls wherefore the

Doctrine
The salvation of the soul is of vastly more worth and value than the whole world
And this we shall endeavor to make out by these following particulars

I Because all worldly good things shall have an end First the world in general shall one day have an end the very earth itself with all the works of it shall be burnt up the very elements shall melt with fervent heat and the heavens too shall pass away 2 Peter 310 Matthew 2435 and Revelation 2011 All the hosts of heaven shall be dissolved and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll and their host shall fall down as a leaf falleth off from the vine and a falling fig from the figtree then everything shall be devoured in the flames together and then where will be all the fine cities of the world with which the earth now prides herself Where will be all the silver and gold which is so hugged and made so much a god of in the world What then will become of the kingdoms and great monarchies of the earth Where will be the proud palaces of potentates and emperors and whatsoever else the proud men of the world do glory in and swell themselves with the thoughts of They shall all be burnt up together in the same fire in which the men themselves who so set their hearts upon those things as to make them their happiness shall be burnt up

II The whole world shall have an end with respect to every particular person at death When a man dies the world has an end with respect to him all worldly pleasure profits and honors with him are come to an end To what advantage then will be bags of gold and silver If he hugs them never so close he must leave them forever and ever when once he leaves the world What great comfort will it be to him then to think that while he lived he lived in great pomp that he had all things at command was arrayed in gorgeous and shining apparel was lifted up in point of riches and honor above others of his fellow men insomuch that he used to look upon them as worms under his feet To what pleasure will it be to him to see men come bowing and cringing to him when he is dying What pleasure will it be to him to think he has great affluence of sensual pleasure and delight What good will it do him then that he used to rule with uncontrolled dominion over a great part of the earth or if he could grasp the whole world when he is dying What good did it do Alexander Magnus when he was dying to think that he had conquered the whole world He must leave his conquered world to him upon whom God in his providence pleases to bestow it though he conquered the world yet death must have a conquest over him at last and he whom the whole could not contain must at last be confined to only a narrow grave A few feet square of ground is large enough for him now whom the earth was not broad enough for before The rich man who fared sumptuously every day and shone in gorgeous apparel at last begs that he may receive a drop of water of him whom he used to look upon as his dog in his lifetime See Luke 1619 and onward see there what became of the rich man who was so rich that he had no room where to bestow his riches He talks of pulling down his barns and building greater and there he would bestow all his goods and says to his soul Thou hast much goods laid up for many years Take thine ease eat drink and be merry But God says unto him Thou fool this night thy soul shall be required of thee then whose shall those things be which thou has provided

III Worldly good things are very uncertain and oftentimes come to an end before death There is no certainty of anything here below if we were sure we should live always it is quite uncertain and precarious whether or no we should enjoy worldly goods There are many accidents may deprive us of them and when we think we hold them fastest they oftentimes slip out of our hands soonest when we think there is least danger there is oftentimes  yea most commonlythe greatest danger of losing of them A man may be so deprived of worldly good things whilst alive that he had better be dead than alive for matter of any temporal good he enjoys There have been such instances in the world before now and many such happen without doubt every day but one alone shall suffice at this time namely that of Job He without doubt enjoyed as many worldly good things as almost any man in the world See Job 134 His substance was also seven thousand sheep and three thousand camels and five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred she asses and a very great household so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east And his sons went and feasted in their houses every one his day and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them And there is no reason to think but that he held them with as little danger of losing of them but see what becomes of all those things from the thirteenth verse to the end of the nineteenth

And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brothers house and there came a messenger unto Job and said The oxen were plowing and the asses feeding beside them and the Sabeans fell upon them and took them away yea they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword and I only am escaped alone to tell thee While he was yet speaking there came also another and said The fire of God is fallen from heaven and hath burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them and I only am escaped alone to tell thee While he was yet speaking there came also another and said The Chaldeans made out three bands and fell upon the camels and have carried them away yea and slain the servants with the edge of the sword and I only am escaped alone to tell thee While he was yet speaking there came also another and said Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brothers house and behold there came a great wind from the wilderness and smote the four corners of the house and it fell upon the young men and they are dead and I only am escaped alone to tell thee

But yet this is not all see the second chapter the seventh and eighth verses How easily may a man be deprived of his substance either by fire or water or the wind or the earthobnoxious to be destroyed by all the elements And then how easily is a man deprived of his honor and reputation in the world how many men have been brought down from the highest worldly glory to the meanest and most shameful state and condition How uncertain are friends and relatives their being dear to us wont keep them from being taken from us When deaths time comes all the world cant hinder them from parting How many diseases are there which deprive many men of a capacity of enjoying any of the comforts or pleasures of life and there are innumerable unforeseen accidents which may deprive us of them

And what if a man doth live to grow old and none of those accidents happen Yet there is but a little part of this life that man is capable of tasting worldly pleasures Old age will certainly come on in a little time and the days wherein we shall say we have no pleasure in them when the sun and the light the moon and the stars shall be darkened and the clouds return after the rain when the keepers of the house shall tremble and the strong men shall bow themselves and the grinders cease because they are few and those that look out at the windows shall be darkened and the doors shall be shut in the streets when the sound of the grinding is low and we shall rise up at the voice of the bird and all the daughters of music shall be brought low and when we shall be afraid of that which is high and fears shall be in the way and the almond tree shall flourish and the grasshopper shall be a burden and desire shall end because at last man must go to our long home and the mourners go about the street And then the silver cord must be loosed and the golden bowl broken the pitcher broken at the fountain and the wheel at the cistern and the dust must return to the earth as it was and the spirit return to God who gave it Justly then may we cry out Vanity of vanities all is vanity as in the twelfth chapter of Ecclesiastes

But on the other hand

IV The soul is immortal and shall certainly endure forever and ever We have heard that all worldly things shall certainly be destroyed at the end of the world and besides that they will certainly be at an end with respect to every particular man at death and oftentimes come to an end before death and there is not the least certainty of their enduring till that time And if man live to old age the enjoyment of them will certainly be at an end before death and if he dont live to old age then they will certainly be at an end before that time comes But none of these things are so with respect to the soul when heaven and earth shall be destroyed when everything upon the face of the earth shall be burnt up when the sea shall be dried up Revelation 211 And there was no more sea when the sun moon and stars shall come to an end the soul shall endure still When the body shall die and return to dust the soul shall remain when worldly good things shall have an end by accidents by diseases or old age the soul will remain The world shall continue but a few moments but the soul shall remain throughout all eternity the world shall last no longer than the conflagration but the soul shall last through an eternity that has no end Worldly profits and pleasures shall last no longer than the body and many times not half so long but the soul shall last as long as God lasts Surely that which lasts forever if it be worth anything if it lasts always must be worth vastly more than that which lasts but a little while that good which lasts millions of ages must be worth more than that which lasts but a minute but eternity is infinitely more longer than the life of man than a thousand years is than a minute

V All the world if it could be enjoyed forever would be little worth Solomon who knew better the value of the world than any man in the world because of his great wisdom and had more experience and better opportunities to know than any man ever had yet cries out All is vanity and vexation of spirit He is so full of it that he breaks out upon it his very first words as soon as he begins to write his book of Ecclesiastes are vanity of vanities that is the greatest vanity of all vanities vanity of vanities repeated over again all is vanity and so in the third verse What profit hath a man of all his labor under the sun He tells us that he had seen them all that is enjoyed them all and behold all was vanity and vexation of spirit as in the fourteenth verse He tells us that he got himself wisdom that is worldly wisdom that he set himself to try mirth and pleasure He tells us he got himself houses and vineyards gardens orchards trees and all kinds of fruits and servants and maidens and great possessions and cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before He got him silver and gold men singers and women singers and all sorts of instruments of music and whatsoever his eyes desired he kept not from them neither did he withhold his heart from any joy And then he tells us that all was vanity and vexation of spirit and there was no profit under the sun and is any man so vain and foolish as to think he knows better than Solomon or if he thinks he doth does he know better than God by whose spirit he speaks

There is so much disappointment so much vexation so little solid pleasure in the enjoyment of any of these things that render them all truly such as Solomon describes them to be nothing but vanity and vexation of spirit And a very great plenty of them are more of a burden than a comfort and but a very poor enjoyment for eternity and such as a wise man would never be contented to take up with and indeed it is the goodness of God that he has not appointed these things for our portion But we shall speak of each of the good things of this world in particular

First Riches are in themselves of little worth If a man were to enjoy as much silver and gold as he could wish for he would find but very little satisfaction And what rich man has there ever been whom riches have made happy Kings and great men of the world are generally as unhappy as poor men and have generally as much trouble and affliction with worldly good things as poor men have for want of them Riches are given to men only for them to carry to support them through the wilderness of this world in the way to heaven and generally the more riches the greater the burden and that is but poor provision generally to live upon through ones life that one is forced to take up with in a journey through a desolate wilderness Neither would one be willing to carry that burthen all ones life that they may be willing to bear on a journey and besides worldly riches are so far from bringing satisfaction with them the more one has of them the more we want That is but a poor sort of drink which instead of quenching thirst the more one drinks the more thirsty they are

Second It is so with respect to honor and worldly pomp Honor may at first mightily please men and puff them up very full with a mean and unworthy sort of pleasure but that is soon over and men generally except they are very foolish and vain indeed grow more into a distaste of it all the happiness that is enjoyed in it is only because other men think them happy and not from any solid or substantial happiness that is found therein A wise man if it were not that he desired it for the public good would be glad to be delivered from the burthen of it and enjoy the happiness of a more refined life with only the enjoyment of some select friends than be entangled and hampered with great and honorable posts and places

Third Worldly pleasure is in itself but a worthless thing Men generally have very great expectations from sensual pleasure before their enjoyment but they almost vanish in the enjoyment and men that have great expectations from them are always disappointed They are like shadows and phantoms which vanish as we endeavor to embrace them and if one doth enjoy them to the full their nature will allow them to last but a very short time and after one is a little used to them they are loathed and hated

Fourth Tis so with respect to friends Indeed the pleasures of friendship have the preference to all worldly things but these also if we view them narrowly we shall find unworthy of setting our hearts much upon First because our temporal or earthly friends are unable to keep off evils and distresses from us let them be never so near and entire friends all that they can do for us for the most part is but to wish and desire our welfare They are unable to keep off misfortunes from happening unto us and let them lay out themselves never so much they cannot secure us against troubles and afflictions there never was an earthly friend yet let him be never so friendly let him be never so rich powerful and great that could secure from crosses trouble and afflictions Secondly the best of them are uncertain there is no certainty of the best friends not separating and falling Human nature even in the best is so full of infirmities and inconstancies that there is no depending nor trusting the best of them all

So that we see that if this world and the good things of the same could be enjoyed forever it would be but of small value We have seen that riches are so inasmuch as they afford no solid satisfaction to the mind and generally bring more vexation than comfort and when they are in abundance are more of a burthen than a delight We have seen that worldly honor and pomp is so and that the pleasure that is enjoyed therein is but a mere shadow and vanity we have seen that worldly pleasures are so inasmuch as they always bring disappointment and always cheat and deceive those who pursue them and because they are naturally incapable of enduring long and generally bring distaste and loathing after them we have seen that friends are also so inasmuch as their love is not very profitable to us they being unable to save us from misfortunes and besides they are uncertain and inconstant And in short that all this world with all its riches glories pleasures and delights is but the greatest of vanities and a mere vexation of spirit But

VI The life and salvation of the soul is of inestimable worth and value Though the whole world is good for nothing in comparison yet the life of the soul is of inestimable worth and value insomuch that the value of the same cannot be conceived of nor imagined and that appears

First because the salvation of it is the deliverance of it from so great misery and secondly because so great happiness is to be enjoyed in the salvation of the soul

First Because the salvation of the soul is its deliverance from so great misery This misery which the soul is saved from is very dreadful

1 Because in it they shall be deprived of all manner of good forever

1 They shall be deprived of all the pleasures they used to enjoy in this world They shall no more enjoy the pleasures of eating and drinking no more enjoy the pleasures of seeing and hearing they shall no more enjoy their lusts there shall be nothing in hell for men to satisfy their lust upon They will have taken their leave then of all the riches honors and pleasure of the world which they used so to hug and make a god of their dear lusts which were so dear to them that they would not part with them for heaven that they would not let go of for God himself and all the happiness which God could bestow upon them they must part with them for nothing now never to enjoy anything like them again If they have been used to please themselves by handling of their silver and gold with the shining of precious stones and jewels they shall enjoy no more of them forever if they have been used to gorgeous apparel and to deck themselves with shining and glistening robes they shall never more be clothed with any other sort of garments but scorching and tormenting flames which will wrap themselves about their otherwise naked bodies forever if they have been used to dwell in proud and stately palaces upon earth they will have nothing for their habitation then but the bottomless pit and the dismal and doleful dungeon of outer darkness instead of lying at ease in beds of down they shall have nothing but a sea of liquid fire for their bed flames instead of the wine and strong drink with which they used to intoxicate themselves they shall have nothing but the cup of Gods wrath and fiery indignation which they shall be compelled forever to drink Instead of that wicked company which they used so much to delight in they shall have nothing but damned sprights for their company in hell instead of their cursing and swearing lewd and debauched conversation they shall yell and roar out forever and ever under Gods dreadful wrath

2 They shall be deprived of spiritual pleasures and communion with God They shall see many come from the east and from the west and sit down with Abraham Isaac and Jacob and they themselves cast out to weep and gnash their teeth Matthew 81112 They may knock at the door forever and never receive any other answer but Depart from me I know you not ye workers of iniquity They will be bound hand and foot and cast into outer darkness and shall never be admitted to the wedding Their beholding the happiness of others who shall be with God in heaven and to think that they might have enjoyed the same had not they been fools will be an inexpressible aggravation of their misery they will see then that nothing in the world is so valuable as the favor of God which they have lost and which they so much despised while here on earth they will see then how excellent heaven and the happiness thereof is which they used so to laugh at and scorn when they might have obtained it if they would they shall see how wise those persons were which they used so to despise and have in derision

2 This misery from which the soul that is saved is saved from is dreadful because of the positive torments which shall be endured How much doth a single spark of fire if it remain upon any part of the flesh torment one How much must the body be tormented that is plunged all over in a sea of fire When only some one part of the body is in pain by the toothache or headache how troublesome is it and such as one would not endure always without ceasing upon any consideration how dreadful must it be to have every part of the body in most exquisite torment both within and without and not only the body but the soul too

3 The misery from which the soul is saved is dreadful because it is eternal and mixed with despair After the soul and body have roasted millions of ages in hellfire it will not be at all nearer the end of its misery and this the soul shall know and be assured of and shall not in the least doubt of it If a man were sure that he must bear the pain he feels only from a drop of scalding water throughout eternity without intermission the thoughts of it would fill the mind with dreadful horror and amazement with what horror then must it fill the mind at the same instant that it feels helltorments to know and be assured that it must feel those same torments forever and ever

Thus we have represented to you something of the misery which the soul that is saved is saved from which without doubt is so dreadful in itself that if we had a clear and full apprehension of it only barely an idea of it without any fear of our bearing of it that it would overcome human nature and kill us immediately Of how much value then must the salvation of the soul be which is salvation from so great a misery Deliverances are reckoned great or small according to the greatness of the evil which we are delivered from wherefore without doubt the deliverance of the soul from hell is of more value than all the worldHere ends the first preaching unit At the head of the second unit is a brief summary which was read at the start of the sermon a necessary part of an oral sermon of more than one preaching unit though irrelevant to a literary sermon not delimited by pulpit time blocks
Doctrine That the salvation of the soul is of vastly more worth and value than the whole world by showing the world in general should come to an end at the conflagration of the world and that it should come to an end with respect to every particular person at death by showing the uncertainty fodeyness and vanity of the world whereby it is liable to come to an end before death by showing that the soul was immortal that if all the world could be enjoyed forever it would be little worth we showed that riches were little worth that honors were little worth that worldly pleasure is so likewise that earthly friends are in comparison but little worth we showed in the sixth place that the salvation of the soul was more worth than all the world because it is of inestimable worth and value And that because it is deliverance from so great misery and we showed that the misery from which a saved soul was delivered was very great because in it the soul was deprived of all good all evil was brought upon it this misery would be eternal and mixed with despair We shall now proceed to show that

Second The salvation of the soul is of inestimable worth and value because the happiness that will be enjoyed by every saved soul will be inestimable first because the saved soul shall be delivered from all evil secondly shall be brought to the enjoyment of all good thirdly this happiness shall be eternal

1 Shall be delivered from all evil There shall be nothing to interrupt the happiness of believers there shall no evil approach the gates of heaven

1 They shall be perfectly delivered from sin and temptation The saved soul leaves all its sin with the body when it puts off the body of the man it puts off the body of sin with it When the body is buried all sin is buried forever and though the soul shall be joined to the body again yet sin shall never return more it is sown in corruption but shall be raised in incorruption sown in dishonor but shall be raised in glory sown in weakness but raised in power sown a natural body but raised a spiritual body and this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal immortality when deathnot only natural death but spiritual deathshall be swallowed up in victory Sin is always a great trouble and affliction to the godly in this life They have frequent combats fought between the body of death and the spirit of life between the law of the members and the law of the mind but after death there shall be no more such strifes there shall be no more assaults of lusts to be resisted there they shall not be afflicted with the temptations of Satan he shall never come near heaven to lay snares and practice his wiles They shall no more be tempted by the shining vanities they shall then live in a world which as it will be infinitely above this for gloriousness and excellency so the glory of it will not draw them from God but only excite and stir them up to praises of him and give them to see what a mere vanity this world is in comparison of it This life is a warfare to believers against these adversaries and they must sometimes even agonize against them in order to overcome them but there they shall be perfectly free from all these things that life will be a sort of a perpetual triumph over these enemies instead of a warfare with them

The saved soul shall be unspotted without spot or wrinkle or any such thing Ephesians 527 They shall be holy unblamable and unreprovable in the sight of God they shall be pure as the light itself

2 It shall be delivered from all manner of affliction Good men in this world oftentimes meet with abundance of affliction many travel so as it were through a sea of blood This is a very troublesome world full of crosses and disappointments full of cares and solicitudes and full of fears and anxieties Good men in this world are hated by this world scorned despised and often persecuted by them Hebrews 113538 And others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings yea moreover of bonds and imprisonments They were stoned they were sawn asunder were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins being destitute afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy They wandered in deserts and mountains and in fens and caves of the earth but when they get to heaven there will be no more of this they will never more be afflicted either by misfortunes and evil accidents sickness shame disgrace fears and cares but they shall rest from their labors They shall wash their robes which were stained with their own blood they shall have all tears wiped away from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying

2 They shall be brought to the enjoyment of all good In heaven all the faculties of the soul shall be completely satisfied The understanding shall there be satisfied the understanding as it enters into heaven shall as it were come out of a dark and gloomy place into a place that is full of heavenly light A great deal of pleasure it is that wise men have by that little understanding which they have here what then will the saints enjoy in heaven where their knowledge and understanding will be so enlarged The will also will be completely satisfied there whatsoever they desire shall be bestowed upon them The affections also will be satisfied their love will be very much enlarged and yet satisfied They shall live in a most glorious place the heaven of heavens Gods throne and the palace of his glory If the palaces of earthly princes are so glorious how glorious must that be which is the palace of Jehovah If the temple at Jerusalem a temple of mens building was so splendid and glorious as to cause the Queen of Sheba even to swoon at the very sight of it how glorious must that temple be which the Almighty has built for himself with his own hands

But the dwelling in such a glorious place is but the least part of the happiness of heaven There is the conversation with saints with holy men of old Moses Job David Elijah etc with the prophets and apostles and besides that with the man Christ Jesus who was crucified for mankind at Jerusalem Neither is that the chief thing the Beatifical Vision of God that is the tip of happiness To see a God of infinite glory and majesty face to face to see him as he is and to know him as we are known there to be admitted into the most intimate acquaintance with him to be embraced as in his arms this is such a privilege as Moses himself could not be admitted to while on earth The vision and fruition of God will be so intimate and clear as to transform the soul into the likeness of God We shall be like him for we shall see him as he is says the Apostle 1 John 32

3 This happiness shall be eternal This crowns it however great the happiness of heaven were in itself yet it would detract from it if it were not to be eternal If the saints in heaven were sure they should enjoy heaven some thousands of years and after that it should be at an end it would cast a great damp upon their joys and delights it would much grieve them to think that they should lose so great a happiness and at last it would be a cloud in their light a bitter in the midst of their sweet But it is not so they are sure that they shall enjoy it forever and this redoubles the joy Rev And they shall reign forever and ever So great is the happiness of the saved soul They shall be delivered from all manner of sin temptation trouble and affliction and shall live in the palace which God has built and where he himself doth dwell and there shall enjoy everything they wish for They shall enjoy the company of prophets apostles martyrs angels and archangels they shall see the man Christ Jesus and even Jehovah himself the Eternal Three in One and shall be intimately united to him and this happiness of theirs shall endure as long as God endures How precious then must the salvation of that soul be in whose salvation is so much happiness

VII The salvation of the soul is more worth than all the world because the world can be of no advantage at all if the soul is lost

First Because there can be no enjoyment of the world in that misery into which the lost soul will be plunged and this is that which is most immediately implied in our text What would it profit a man if he should gain the whole world and lose his own soul That is what would all this world profit a man that he had all the world in his possession while on earth if he loses his soul at last What will it profit him then if he lives all his lifetime drowned in pleasure and honors What will it profit him that he was arrayed in silver and gold once that he wore a crown on his head and held a scepter in his hand All his riches and honors wont cool his tongue but rather increase the flame by which he is tormented If he could have his gold and silver all in hell with him what good would it do him Every time he looked upon it it would only fill him with the greater torment that he did not improve the same to better purposes upon earth It will nothing but add twinges to his torment to think in how great prosperity he lived while on earth and in what misery he is now plunged into every thought of it will be as a drop of scalding brimstone falling upon him which will cause him to roar out forever and ever

Second The world can be of no profit if the soul is lost inasmuch as the soul is in effect the man The soul is in effect the man and the body without it is no more than a stick or a stone Tis the soul that thinks that perceives pleasure that enjoys good and the body without the soul enjoys nothing Nay there is not so much as external sense without the soul the body cannot enjoy any of its worldly pleasures and good things without it none of the senses can be gratified without it the eyes can behold no pleasant sights the ear can hear no music the palate can taste no sweetness nor any of the senses be gratified Well then and what is all the world worth to a man if he himself be lost what is the world good for if there be no man to enjoy it or in the words of our text as they may be interpreted what will it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose himself Soul in the Scriptures is often put for self

VIII It appears that the salvation of the soul is more worth than all the world because God himself has set such an high value upon it Without doubt if God values the soul above all the world then the salvation of it is more worth than all the world For God is a God of infinite knowledge and wisdom and certainly knows the value of the soul and the value of the world also but God has prized the soul above all the world

First Inasmuch as he has made all the worldthat is all this worldfor the sake of the soul nothing is plainer than that the soul must be more worth than all the world If the world is made for the soul it is always a maxim finis est prestantior mediis the end is more excellent than the mean but that the world was made for the sake of the soul the very make of things evidences and it might easily be discovered had we no revelation of it Nothing is plainer to reason than that the earth the sea the air cattle trees and all were made for man and fitted to his use but besides reason the Scriptures also plainly tell us as much God created the world first as an habitation and afterward created man as the inhabitant and gave him rule over all things which plainly evidences that all things were made for him and therefore God by making the world for man has set a higher value upon him than the world The world is but a tabernacle or house and surely the inhabitants are more than the house If the inhabitants are lost what is the house worth to those inhabitants

Second Inasmuch as he has sent so many of his servants the prophets to the end that the souls of men might be saved God in his Word makes mention of this as a great instance of his care for the salvation of men 2 Chronicles 3615 And the Lord God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers rising up betimes and sending them because he had compassion on his people and on his dwelling place and Jeremiah 725 Since the day that your fathers came out of Egypt to this I have even sent unto you all the prophets daily rising up early and sending them and so in the twentyfifth chapter at the fourth verse And it certainly is a great and astonishing instance of Gods care and concern for the salvation of mens souls to condescend to inspire some particular men for their sake to condescend to speak to men face to face and have an immediate intercourse with them surely it is a thing very astonishing that the Almighty Jehovah should speak to men and converse with men but God has done this very frequently and almost continually from the creation of the world into the captivity into Babylon and not only to inspire them but to work many wonderful miracles by them How often has even the very course of nature been altered and the laws of nature been made to stand by for the sake of the welfare of mens souls Before the flood doubtless God had very frequent intercourse with good men as we know he had with Adam with Abel with Enoch and with Noah and after the flood God for some time used to do likewise as with Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph etc and it was all to this end even the salvation of the soul To this end did God work all those wonders in the land of Egypt to this end ultimately it was that he divided the Red Sea and caused the Children of Israel to pass over dryshod to this end did God descend upon Mount Sinai in such a wonderful and awful manner and there speak to Moses as a man speaketh with his friend to this end was Jordan divided and the Canaanites driven out from before the Children of Israel and to this end was all that intercourse that God had with the Children of Israel throughout the times of the Old Testament

Third Inasmuch as he has sent his own son into the world to die for the sake of the salvation of the soul of man how highly hes prized the salvation of the soul That he should send his own and only son from the highest heavens from his own bosom down to earth to die for the sake thereof that God who had no need of us whom the salvation of our souls will not profit in anywise should as it were give up one that was the very same in substance with himself one who was infinitely nearer and dearer to him than the nearest and dearest relations amongst men that he should deliver up such an one to be cruelly killed and tormented for the salvation of the soul surely the salvation of the soul must be very precious or else God would never value it so much as to give his son for it What a price is here set upon salvation of the soulthe blood of the Son of God Would any man give up his only son that was very dear to him into the hands of wicked and cruel men to be dreadfully tormented for anything but what was very precious The same with infinitely more reason may we conclude that God would never give up his son to be cruelly tormented and killed for anything but what was very precious and valuable but this hath God done for the sake of the salvation of the soul Certainly then the salvation of the soul must be more worth than all the world Can any man be so mad as to think that God would be giving his son to die that men might have gold and silver or that they might live in worldly pleasure and honor Surely no Wherefore God has set a higher price on the soul than on the whole world

Thus we have endeavored to show that the salvation of the soul is more worth than the whole world and I suppose it is by this time so plain that it is impossible for a man to doubt of it

Use

Inf I Our miserable and lost estate by nature Is the soul so precious and is the salvation of the soul more worth than all the world and the loss of the soul more than the loss of all the world Then how dreadful is our lost condition by nature for our souls naturally are all lost souls naturally in a lost estate and condition bound over unto the eternal wrath of God and to suffer his indignation forever We are all by nature children of wrath Ephesians 23 we are naturally condemned to everlasting misery we are naturally unbelieving and he that believeth not is condemned already John 318 What a dreadful thing is it to be a condemned person A person that is condemned to a bodily death is looked upon as a miserable creature how much more miserable are those which are condemned to spiritual and eternal death but so we are all by nature

Inf II The great folly of the greatest part of the world They neglect their souls and do nothing pursue violently after the pleasure and vain profits of the world They are laboring for those vanities of vanities as if they were the most precious things imaginable and neglect that which is really so they spend themselves for the world as if they were to live in the same forever and ever whereas it will fade and vanish like a phantom in a few moments and they must be parted from it forever and see it no more at all Thus foolish and sottish are the greatest part of the world they take care for the world but take no care for themselves they love the world but hate their own souls

Well is it so Then

Exh I Let us take utmost care that we dont lose our souls For what will it profit us if we gain the whole world and lose our own soul and what will we give in exchange for our souls We have now heard the most powerful arguments in the world to persuade us to take care of our souls We have first heard Christ Jesus with his own mouth declaring that if we gain the whole world and lose our own souls it will not profit us Where is a man that dont take care to get the world that is not willing to spend much labor and strength rather than not get the world rather than have none of the world How are men continually busied in getting the world If we look out into this city at any time we may behold men of all kinds earnest in pursuit of the world and why should not men take as much care of that which is so much more valuable and precious even the salvation of the soul without which the world is good for nothing Why should we labor and spend ourselves for that which will shortly be at an end and all the while neglect that which will endure forever and ever why should we take so much care for that which we must leave and take an everlasting farewell of in a very short time and be careless of that which if we obtain it shall never be separated from us Why should we be anxious for that which is changeable fading and vanishing and liable to be destroyed by innumerable accidents which the very moth and rust can despoil us of and take no thought for such a treasure as neither moth nor rust can conquer nor thieves break through and steal

What folly is it to be so very careful for that which if it could be enjoyed forever would be very little worth and yet be careless of that which is of such inestimable value and worth How unreasonable is it for us to labor so earnestly for a worthless world and not regard our deliverance from most dreadful torments which shall endure forever and not take care to secure to ourselves complete and eternal happiness to be unconcerned about that misery which we shall unavoidably fall into if we do not take much care and which all careless persons are going with a swift career into and yet be so much concerned about the world which we cannot enjoy there How ridiculous is it for a man to moil and toil spend and be spent for the world and for worldly enjoyment and all the while care not what becomes of himself to be concerned for a world to enjoy and not to be at all concerned for himself that enjoys it to be anxious about his habitation and take no care for himself that inhabits it Let us not therefore act so exceeding foolishly ridiculously and unreasonably let us take no thought for this present any otherwise than as the means of the good of our souls and let us take utmost care of our precious and immortal souls and not neglect them

And that we may be stirred up thereunto let us consider these two things first the danger of neglecting our souls secondly the inexcusableness of it

First The danger If we neglect our souls they will most certainly presently be lostas certainly as a stone will roll down a hill if it be not held up If we neglect our souls they will in a very short time be in hellflames and the longer we neglect them the worse it will be and the more difficult to stop them in their career The soul in its fallen estate naturally tends to hell and destruction as much as a stone tends to the center of the earth and the farther it goes the faster the swifter and more impetuous is its course wherefore we must take utmost care

Second Consider the inexcusableness of neglecting the salvation of our souls

1 We cannot plead impotency We cannot plead that we are not able to take care of our souls for we certainly can if we will There never was a man yet that endeavored to take care for the salvation of his soul and found that he could not

2 Nor we cannot plead the difficulty of it We find that taking care for other things is not so difficult but that we conquer the difficulty no man lies still and starves and pleads that there is a great deal of difficulty in laboring and taking care for food How would such an excuse be laughed at by everyone and it is a thousand times as ridiculous for a man to lie down in everlasting burnings and then plead that it was a difficult and troublesome thing for him to take care to shun and avoid it No this will not do let no man feed himself up with thoughts of making this excuse on the great day of accounts Let every man take as much care for the salvation of his immortal soul as the generality of men do to get the world be as careful as steady and as laborious in it as persevering and unweariedand there is a greater probability of his obtaining life everlasting than of the careful laborious mans obtaining the worldand that he will be brought to   and without doubt he will have life everlasting will be saved from hell and will be brought to everlasting happiness and the enjoyments of heaven including the society of saints and angels there the sight of the man Christ Jesus and the Beatifical Vision of Jehovah himself the Eternal Three in One God blessed forevermore

3 We cannot plead ignorance We cannot plead that we did not know that we had souls to save we cannot plead that we did not know that there was such need of caring for our souls in order to their salvation we cannot plead that we did not know that our souls were worthy of taking care for How fully have we been instructed in those matters in Gods Word and how frequently are we there commanded to take care of our souls how frequently are we told that if we do not we shall certainly be damned forever We live in a land where there are Bibles enough for us to read and where we are not prohibited from reading of them and if we do not read it is our own fault and if we are ignorant when we have such opportunities to know what excuse will that be to us And besides none of us here present can after this time plead any such excuse for if we never knew before we know how we have now heard sufficiently both of the worth of the salvation of the soul and the danger of neglecting it

Third We shall give some directions that we may know aright to care for our souls

1 We must take care not to walk in those ways in which if we walk we shall be certainly lost If we would not be lost we must not take wrong paths if we continue to walk in those ways which lead to destruction without doubt we shall come to destruction at last We all know that the ways of sin and iniquity are wrong paths everyone knows that all the paths that are contrary to Gods commands are paths that lead to destruction and that they all meet together in hell wherefore let us take care that we do not walk in those paths

2 We must seek unto God that he would save our souls we are weak and unable to save ourselves We cannot do it without Gods help except he put forth his hand and help we shall not be able to escape destruction and misery We are like persons that are falling from a precipice into some dreadful pit and cannot possibly stop ourselves from falling still further We must look and pray to God for help or else we are inevitably lost

3 We must in these things strive with all our might If we think to have our souls saved we must strive and labor for it some little care and concern will not do We must not think that barely seeking will do but we must strive also nothing that is great and excellent is attained unto without difficulty riches are not to be gotten without difficulty earthly honor and reputation and renown is not to be attained without much difficulty learning and wisdom requires a steady labor and industry before it can be obtained and can any man think that such things as these require the greatest diligence and that heaven and the salvation of the soul may be had without pains and industry The Christian life for that reason because of the diligence and labor that is required in it is called a race and a warfare because in running and fighting generally the utmost of the powers are laid out Let us therefore not spare any pains and labors in these things let us deny ourselves of those things which are most dear to us when they stand in the way of our duty let us deny ourselves of all our lusts and fight valiantly and vigorously against our spiritual adversaries let us resist them with all our might and not give an inch of ground to them Let us call in all our powers and lay them out against whatsoever opposes us in this way of Gods commands Let us press forward in the way to heaven violently for many there are that seek that shall not be able Matthew 1112 The kingdom of heaven suffers violence and the violent take it by force Let us therefore so run as not uncertainly so fight not as one that beateth the air for they that run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize Let us therefore keep under our bodies and bring them into subjection

4 Let us strive thus constantly and steadily Let us keep our minds steadily and constantly upon heaven the prize of our high calling and let us be continually meditating on heavenly things Let us run in the way of Gods commands without flagging or fainting we must not think that our striving will do if it be only by fits and starts but we must strive constantly and unweariedly men dont use to stop sometime and run sometime when they were upon a race men when they are engaged immediately in a battle dont use to stand still now and then to rest when their enemies are about them for if they so do they are in danger every minute of being killed

Exh II Let us do our utmost to forward the salvation of other men their souls are as precious as our own Is it not a great pity that things which are so precious as souls are should be lost Should we not if we saw any man in distress of body and in great danger of dying be willing to lend him a hand to save his life Why let us look about us and we shall see thousands of men in a sorrowful condition and in danger of dying every moment Should we see a man adrowning should not we be willing to afford him some assistance to help him out of the water If we look about us we may see thousands of poor souls drowning in sin and iniquity and in danger of being drowned in the lake of fire and brimstone Let us therefore do what we can for them perhaps we may be instrumental of saving several souls from everlasting ruin and destruction If each one here present should do what he could towards it there is no doubt to be made but that many souls might be saved by their means Let us therefore do our utmost dont let us be so inhuman as to see men sick and not help them

Appendix to Matthew 1626

First Let us take all opportunities to persuade men less to mind earthly things and more to regard the affairs of their souls There is scarcely any man high nor low but what if prudence be used in observing the proper time and manner may have an opportunity of doing a great deal of good this way

Persons generally excuse themselves from this and say To what purpose would it be for me to concern myself to go to persuade and exhort them or to reprove them for their wickedness for their ill language their rude and debauched conversation Theyll regard it no more than a puff of wind theyll nothing but make a laugh and a ridicule of it I shall be reproached by them and theyll be never the better will no way alter their behavior But nevertheless there are opportunities through which if they were diligently observed we might speak to good purpose and we should not be likely to be reproached for it And whether twas much regarded in the time of it or no yet if it were done prudently and with understanding would be likely to be called over in his mind and perhaps make some impression on his heart

Gods providence is very variable toward all persons Sometimes they are in prosperity and sometimes they are brought to sorrow and mourning by this variety God by turns is striving with mens hearts and these changes give opportunities of speaking for the salvation of the soul of our fellow creatures wherein a prudent person might reasonably speak to good effect and it may be redeem the soul of his brother from the hand of the Adversary Proverbs 251112 A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver as an earring of gold and an ornament of fine gold so is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear

Prudence is likewise to be used in choosing the persons that we would persuade as well as the opportunity If there are some persons that are like swine that will trample pearls under their feet and turn again and rent us yet all are not so some have more morality and civility in them and some are of a more kindly natural temper and if we could do good upon no other yet surely we might upon our near friends and familiar acquaintances All men have some that they are more especially acquainted with our interest in such might be improved for Gods sake and for their souls sake

Second Another way wherein we ought to seek the salvation of others souls is by our example No objections can lie against this way of recommending religion and spiritualmindedness we may let others see our minds and know our thoughts of things as well and better by our behavior than by our words

Let all that see our lives see that we for our parts are very much concerned for the good of our souls and that we think that eternal salvation is a matter of the greatest importance This will be a likely way to make others think so far or at least to put them upon thinking whether it is so or no and so bring them to consideration which is a good step Matthew 516 Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your Father which is in heaven This way we may silently reprove and manifest our dislike of vicious conversation and debauched practices by carefully abstaining from them and absenting ourselves from such company and by using ourselves to a conversation that is contrary and savors of other things Hereby it may be we may save souls from death and hide a multitude of sins

Third Another way of promoting the salvation of the souls of others is by doing our part to the promoting and encouraging of the means of grace by endeavoring what in us lies that they shall be dispensed enjoyed and encouraged by showing all respect and reverence to holy things to the sabbath to the word preached and to the sacraments and by watching that we do nothing to hinder them or their efficacy on mens souls

III If the salvation of mens souls is so precious let us be exhorted earnestly to pray for the accomplishment of those times wherein there will be such plentiful effusions of Gods spirit to the conversion of mens souls If the soul of every man is worth more than all the world surely tis lamentable and even dreadful to think that there are but few souls that are saved that far the greatest part are in a state of damnation and going to hell that men are so thinly traveling in the way to heaven and that the way to destruction though so broad is so thronged and crowded

There is a time coming that there will be very great change in the world those nations which now are covered with the darkness of heathenism and idolatry or other false religions shall be enlightened with the truth and there shall be a more extraordinary appearance of the power of godliness amongst those that profess it when Gods spirit shall be poured out on old and young and the knowledge of God shall cover the earth as the waters cover the seas Isaiah 119 When they shall teach no more every man his neighbor and every man his brother saying Know the Lord for they shall all know him from the least to the greatest Jeremiah 3134 When the fullness of the Gentiles shall come in and all Israel shall be saved Romans 112526

These and suchlike expressions signify that all nations shall be Christianized and be visibly holy and that multitudesgreat multitudes all over the face of the earthshall be brought to the saving knowledge of God All those that are truly sensible of the worth of souls will think these very glorious times and will long for them They are generally thought to be very near which is a consideration that ought to stir up all Christians earnestly to pray for them for though God has appointed the time of these things in his own counsels yet he will be enquired of for them by his people before he accomplishes them Ezekiel 363738 Thus saith the Lord God I will yet for this be enquired of by the house of Israel to do it for them I will increase them with men like a flock As the holy flock as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men and they shall know that I am the Lord
