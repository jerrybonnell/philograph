From the beginning of the chapter God had been expostulating with the children of Israel about their apostasy He calls heaven and earth to witness of their departing from him and rebelling against him though he had nourished and brought them up as children and shows them how that they are condemned by the behavior of the very beasts as in the third verse The ox knows his owner and the ass his masters crib but Israel doth not know my people doth not consider And so he goes on in a most pathetical manner pleading with them about the folly and unreasonableness of their degeneracies and their obstinacy in it

From the tenth verse he expostulates with them about their sacrifices and other acts of worship He asks of them to what purpose it is to sacrifice and to hold their solemn assemblies and keep their new moons and sabbaths and appointed feasts and to make many prayers as long as they went on in the practices of injustice and oppression and violence and tells them that the way to be accepted in their services is to put away the evil of their doings to cease to do evil and learn to do well to seek judgment relieve the oppressed judge the fatherless and plead for the widow

And then follows the verses of our text Come now let us reason together God calls upon them to argue and controvert the case with him to bring forth their objections and challenges them to show any fault in his dealings towards them Its very parallel to that place in the fortythird chapter at the twentysixth verse Put me in remembrance let us plead together declare thou that thou mayst be justified and in the fortyfirst chapter at the twentyfirst verse Produce your cause saith the Lord bring forth your strong reasons saith the God of Jacob

In these verses God pleads with his people about the reasonableness and fairness and goodness of his methods of dealing with them

1 In his readiness to pardon their sins Though your sins are as scarlet they shall be as white as snow though they be red like crimson they shall be as wool God always stands ready to pardon and blot out sins of men though they are very great He stood ready to forgive all the sins of his people Israel though their hands were full of blood as in the fifteenth verse Though their sins were as scarlet and crimson of a deep die and of a very heinous nature and such as cried to God for vengeance yet God stood ready to make their souls as white as snow and wool

2 In the reasonableness of the terms of his favor and blessing If ye be willing and obedient ye shall eat the good of the land If once mens stubborn and obstinate wills are brought down God is very free and ready to show mercy to em He insists upon nothing but their being willing to accept of offered mercy and to yield themselves to God and comply with his authority and rule over them and be his subjects

3 In the justice of his anger and punishment But if ye refuse and rebel ye shall be devoured with the sword Refusing is here set in opposition to being willing in the other verses and rebelling to being obedient Hereby abundantly appears the reasonableness of the punishment God inflicts on sinners For in the first place they willfully refuse mercy refuse a dependence on God and how reasonable is it that they should be denied when they themselves refuse and reject God who is the author of mercy And secondly they rebel against him they wont be subject to his government How justly therefore are they punished how just is itMS it that seeing they make war against God that he should make war against them What king wont punish those subjects that rebel against him How much more shall He that regardeth not the person of kings punish those that rebel against him This is the reasoning that God has with his people And the doctrine that we are taught in the words is this

Doctrine
All Gods methods of dealing with men are most reasonable
Here we shall show particularly how God is most reasonable

I In decreeing and permitting sin

II In his choosing some to salvation and leaving others to perish in sin

III In his covenants

IV In his commands

V In his punishments

VI In his providence in this world

In all these things God is most reasonable that is there is nothing in them but what is agreeable to perfect justice and the highest wisdom and nothing contrary to infinite goodness

I God is most reasonable in his decreeing and permitting sin We are taught by Gods Word that God decrees the sins of men they sin according to his determinate counsel and foreknowledge Acts 223 And its impossible but that every one of Gods decrees should come to pass The decree of God dont cause sin there is a great deal of difference between determining that a thing shall be done and to do itMS the doing to do ofit But though the decree of God dont work sin yet its impossible but it should be wrought according to his decree

And God himself orders it so in his providence that all his decrees should be brought about and though he has no positive influence in the evil of sinfor it is impossible he should for the evil of sin is not a positive but a negative thingyet he withholds that grace and influence that would restrain the creature from sinning which grace being withheld sin doth certainly follow

And that God acts most reasonably in thus appointing and permitting sin will appear by the following arguments

First God is no way obliged to afford to his creature such grace and influence as shall render it impossible for him to sin God is not obliged to make the creature unchangeable and at first to be in a confirmed state of holiness so that it should be impossible for him to be otherwise When he thus confirms a creature whether angel or man it is by way of gracious reward for their having fulfilled his covenant Tis only in a state of retribution that God is pleased graciously to oblige himself always to afford such grace that shall at all times either prevent or conquer all temptation but he is no way obliged to afford such grace in the state wherein he is created

God created man in a state of innocency and gave him such grace that he was perfectly free from any corruptions or sinful inclinations nor did he take away that grace from him But neither did he oblige himself to give him more so as certainly to prevent him from giving way to any temptation that was to be given to him when his time of probation was over if he had continued innocent during that probation

God gave man sufficient warning and He had no sinful inclinations to hurry him on to sin he did it of his own free and mere choice Only God did not prevent him by his confirming grace Thus God was not obliged to prevent mans sin by his grace in a state of innocency and if not then surely not now when he is no longer innocent but is become an enemy unto God

Second God may order that a thing shall certainly be done so that it is impossible but that the thing should come to pass and yet not force the doing The certainty and necessity of events is very consistent with the liberty of action Necessity and liberty bent contradictory terms though compulsion and liberty are A thing may be certain and necessary from all eternity as to the futurity of it and the action be done with as much freedom and liberty as ever anything was done in the world It was from all eternity certain absolutely certain that Judas should betray Christ but yet when he did it he did it freely because he himself chose it and did it because he of his own free choice had determined it

Necessity is not opposed to liberty but to contingency to the accidentalness of a thing And compulsion is opposed to liberty Liberty dont consist in an exact indifference to an action so that when it is done it shall be done merely accidentally but it consists in acting according to ones own choice to the counsel of our own will And he that acts according to his own choice acts freely however God has determined that choice and it was absolutely certain from all eternity that the man should make such a choice

That is all the notion that any man can with any propriety have of liberty that a man acts as he himself chooses and as he pleases without considering how he came to choose as he did And a man may act just according to his own will and pleasure and yet it be determined from all eternity absolutely that he should so act And that he should act so out of choice it is not at all inconsistent So that Gods making of it necessary that the thing should so fall out dont in the least stand in the way of our liberty Necessity may be distinguished into necessity of compulsion It is in itself impossible that anything at all should fall out but what in this sense falls out necessarily for if there was a perfect indifferency as to all that preceded or whether such a thing should follow it is impossible it should follow for if it did there would something happen without any cause or reason of its happening which is impossible

God himself does many things necessarily that yet he does freely He necessarily acts justly and he freely acts justly for he does it of his own free choice according to the complacency of his own will

So that although from Gods withholding his grace and assistance and permitting sin man necessarily sinned yet man was at liberty and when he sinned he sinned of his own free choice sinned freely and therefore is justly punished For its agreeable to the light of nature and common sense of all nations that he that commits a fault of his own free choice deserves punishment without inquiring how his choice and his will came to be so bad There could be no such thing as a law no such thing as threatening which is to work on fears

Third If it were not reasonable that God should permit sin God would not be to be feared There would be no foundation for any such thing as the fear of God There would be no such thing as his fearful and awful majesty Tis that wherein the majesty of God very much consists that his displeasure is exceedingly to be dreaded as his favor is infinitely desirable so his anger is infinitely dreadful But if God were obliged not to permit sin there could be no such thing as dreading his displeasure for it would be impossible there should be any such thing as threatening or punishment God would be less to be feared and dreaded than an earthly prince or magistrate We fear their displeasure because we know they have power in their hands and upon that account the wrath of a king is as the roaring of a lion and therefore we so much the more prize their favor because their displeasure is so dreadful But God if he was bound to prevent all sin would not be at all to be dreaded and there would be no grounds of any awful fear and reverence no grounds of care and watchfulness that we might not displease him But this is unreasonable to suppose of the infinitely God

Fourth If God were obliged never to permit sin there would be no reason to thank God for preserving of us from sin and affording his grace We cant be preserved from sin except it be by Gods continual influence and his Spirits upholding of us Tis only by that that we can be preserved Innocency and holiness is preserved in the angels and in all that are holy by the continual efficacy of Gods Spirit as much as light is preserved by the sun But yet according to this supposition we should be under no obligation at all to God for affording of those gracious influences yea the saints and angels in heaven bent at all obliged to God for giving of em perfect holiness Though all holiness comes from him and is every moment maintained by him yet they have no reason to thank him for it God would deserve no praise at all for it if he were obliged to bestow it So that the best gift that God can bestow on a creature even his Spirit would be what we should have no reason to thank him for Therefore doubtless tis unreasonable to suppose that God is obliged to afford so much of his Spirit to all his creatures as to make it impossible that they should sin

Application
We shall make a reflection or two upon this head by way of application before we proceed any further

I Hence we learn that sinners are inexcusable in their sins All the evil of sin is from themselves they have nothing that they can charge God with he is just and righteous and holy in all that he doth relating to the ordering or permitting of their sin they have nowhere else that they can lay any blame but only upon themselves

Twill be no excuse at all to them to say that God decreed their sin and it is impossible but that Gods decrees should come to pass and that he withheld his grace and did not prevent them and that sin necessarily followed for although God permitted them he did not compel nor persuade em nor anyway influence them to do the evil but the origin of it is in their own hearts as we have shown

There is a time coming when they will see the justice and righteousness of God in all that he does relating to it And they will see that they themselves only are to blame

When they come to suffer vengeance God will make them see and know that they themselves were the only blamable procurers of that vengeance It will be no ease to their consciences at all then to say that God appointed their sins and withheld his grace so that sin necessarily followed Their consciences wont excuse them at all the less for this then it wont at all abate of the gnawings of that worm that never dies

Wherefore acknowledge your own inexcusableness now and own that you only are to blame dont complain of God for that for which he justly complains of you and may justly condemn you Cast not the blame of your perverse and willful wickedness on your holy and righteous Maker and judge Who art thou O man that repliest against God and art ready to charge him with your perverseness and presume to say Why doth he yet find fault for any who hath resisted his will for God will not endure such presumption and daring Isaiah 459 Let the potsherds strive with the potsherds of the earth But woe unto him that striveth with his Maker

Dont be objecting and finding fault about mans fall and arguing in your own mind against the justice of God in so ordering and permitting of it And dont murmur and quarrel with God about your own particular sins because God did not restrain you Consider how you have willfully and of your own free choice and without any manner of compulsion done those things that you know God had forbidden and that he warned and exhorted and counseled you against and humble and abase yourself cast yourself down as in the dust and own that nothing but the wrath and vengeance of that holy Being you have offended is your due as Daniel Daniel 97 O Lord righteousness belongeth unto thee but unto us confusion of faces

II Let the mouths of Gods people be filled with his praises for saving them from sin Sinners have great reason to bless God for his restraining them from sin that he has not suffered them to be much worse than they be for God dont owe them his restraining grace But Gods people have much more reason to bless his name that he has not only given them restraining but sanctifying grace God did most justly and reasonably in appointing and permitting the fall of man and so that they should be brought into that miserable and sinful state they are naturally in to have their hearts under the reign and dominion of sin God and his throne is righteous in all this and he might have allowed you to go on without restraint and yet have been just and righteous in his judgments

Therefore you have great reason to praise and magnify his holy name that he has given you his unmerited grace and saved you from sin from the power and dominion of it and given you a principle of holiness If it were unreasonable in God to appoint or permit sin then you would have no cause of thankfulness but as we have showed it is not so Wherefore praise the Lord whilst you have any being and declare the wondrous things that God hath done for you

Doctrine Resumed
II God deals most reasonably with men in choosing some to eternal life and not others This is a doctrine that is exceedingly quarreled with in the world tis a stone of stumbling unto many souls tis a trying doctrine and a doctrine that God revealed partly for the same end as he sends afflictions and persecutions to try man to see what is in man The principal things that they object against the reasonableness of Gods thus dealing are these two

First God makes this distinction by his decree amongst those that are equal for it is done before they are born and so before they have done either good or evil Romans 91113 For the children being not yet born   it was said   Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated And when they are born into the world they are equally partakers of original corruption have hearts alike corrupt and filthy Those that are elected and chosen and those that are not and all the difference there is afterwards God ordered it in his eternal decree

God has no respect in this matter to their good behavior and their righteousness Yea oftentimes those that have been more wicked in their conversations shall be chosen and called when others that are of a more blameless walk shall be left in sin And so they argue against the righteousness of God in making such a distinction as to choose some to eternal life and leave others to suffer forever the torments of hell for their sin And

Second Another thing they object is that this renders it vain and to no purpose to use any means for salvation seeing whatever means are used Gods decree must take place

But these following considerations will clear up the reasonableness of Gods thus by his eternal predestination choosing some to eternal life and leaving others to perish in sin

1 We have shown already that tis a very just and reasonable thing in God to appoint and permit sin and that the sinner is no way excused by it and dont the less deserve punishment for it And therefore

2 God might very justly leave all men universally to perish in sin And if so it cant be unjust in him to leave some of them to perish God because he saves some is not at all the more under obligations to save others if he is under no obligation to save any at all Those that are saved are saved from mere grace and if so it follows that those that perish perish from mere justice for if justice was obliged to save one from perishing it would be no grace to save him Grace and debt are inconsistent Romans 44 Men are all sinners and therefore all of hem deserve eternal misery and them that are appointed to eternal misery are justly and righteously appointed to it And if you say that God appointed that you should be sinners and therefore it necessarily came to pass we have already shown that God deals most justly and reasonably in so doing and therefore no fault can justly be found with Gods dealing in this matter from the beginning to the end

If tis just with God to appoint and permit sin in all mankind and yet just and reasonable in him to punish forever all sinners then none that are thus punished have any reason to complain of the justice of God because of his decree And if they deserve punishment for their sins they dont deserve it the less because others are not punished but are pardoned How doth Gods saving and pardoning one oblige God to pardon and save another If Gods grace is not due to any at all then it is Gods own and that that he may dispose of as he pleases for that is the very notion of a things being ones own that it is at his disposal Therefore if Gods grace is his own he may dispose of it to whom he pleases and may deny it to whom he pleases and nobody has any reason to find fault with him for so doing Matthew 2015 Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own

3 However God has determined in his own secret counsels yet as to those that live under the gospel he dont punish them till they of their own wills have refused the offers of mercy God sets life and death before them and offers them their choice A Savior is proclaimed and offered universally to everyone that will let him come and he shall have life freely

Yea they are beseeched to make a better choice they are told the danger they are in they are told how much better life is than death now dreadful a thing it will be to endure forever the wrath of God how unable they will be to bear it and what a desirable thing Gods favor is and Christ invites them to come unto him yea he beseeches them follows them day after day to persuade them to hearken unto him he karris them by his written Word and by his messengers that he sends to them he oftentimes warns them by his providence and after they notwithstanding all have refused and shown that they will not come unto him that they may have life after they have shown themselves willful and obstinate in the refusals of mercy God casts them into helland whatever Gods decree is tis for this that they are punished That decree as we have heard already laid no restraint upon them they were under no manner of compulsion by it but were left to their own liberty and choice and they refused an offered Savior God is therefore very reasonable with respect to his eternal decrees

4 Salvation is not at all the less connected with the means of it for the decree of God It is not at all the more in vain to use means for salvation because there is a certain number that are elected to salvation because God in the decree itself has connected the end with the means Plowing and sowing and reaping is the means of our having breadcorn and it is not in vain to till the field because God has determined whether we shall have bread to eat or no for God has in his decree connected this end with those means So that if the ground bent tilled we are like to famish and if it be we may hope to enjoy the fruits of our labors So in like manner if we diligently and constantly use the means that God has appointed for our salvation there is great hopes of our being saved but if we neglect them we shall certainly be damned because God in his eternal decree has connected salvation with the means of salvation

Improvement

I If it be so that God deals most reasonably with men in choosing some to eternal life and leaving others to perish in sin then dont let us cavil and find fault with Gods thus dealing If men dont see through all the mystery of Gods dealings yet it is both an unbecoming and unreasonable thing therefore to conclude that they bent just because if they exercised their reason they might conclude that there must necessarily be many things in the works of a Being thats infinitely greater and wiser than they that so little a creature as man cant understand

It shows a great deal of pride and selfconceit in such a man that he should go to set his understanding so much upon a level with Gods Isaiah 559 As the heavens are higher than the earth so are my thoughts higher than your thoughts

It shows but very little modesty that men should dare to determine because Gods ways are out of their sight that they therefore are crooked It shows but a very little sense of their own shortsightedness and of the greatness and glory of God It shows also a great deal of wickedness and that men have neither the fear nor love of God or at least a great deal of the contrary in their hearts that they will arraign his justice and reply against him If they were possessed with a sense of the glory and excellency of God of which we have so many demonstrations they would not be apt to suspect him where they cant see him

It appears to be a very unreasonable thing to imagine that Gods decrees are unjust because they are a mystery that they understand of for how many things seem strange and contradictory that afterwards seem plain and easy There are abundance of things that we see every day that all the wit of men cant explain

We see that there are a great many of the works of men that children cant conceive of they seem to them impossible and contradictions And why therefore should there not be many works of God that men cant see through For is not there a greater difference between men and God than there is between children and men It becomes worms of the dust therefore to subject their understandings to Gods and to own that God knows more than they and not to find fault with what he did from eternal ages in his infinitely wise and holy counsels

II Dont imagine yourself excused because of Gods absolute decrees from the diligent use of the means of your salvation There are some that bent very much concerned about their souls that live in sin and in the allowed neglect of the means they are directed and say unto themselves If I am elected I shall be saved and if not I shall be damned let me do what I will And so they wholly let this business alone though indeed this is only an excuse for a slothful disposition and a love of their lusts and sinful courses

But this will be no excuse for them Nor is their folly the less in neglecting means because Gods decrees are absolute and unchangeable inasmuch as the means of salvation are not at all the less connected with the end as we have shown Yea those persons are witnesses against themselves for they dont neglect means in other affairs theyll use means to obtain the world to get money or lands and to live pleasantly though these things are as much the objects of Gods absolute decrees as the other and the means have a much more uncertain connection with the end

III If God deals most reasonably in choosing some and leaving others then let God have the glory of his sovereignty in so doing God herein doth gloriously manifest his sovereignty and supreme right to all his creatures and tis manifested that we might glorify God for it that we might adore him and fear before his awful majesty Let us not therefore contend with the Almighty about this power of his but rather fall down before his throne and acknowledge that blessing and honor and glory and power belongs to him that sitteth on the throne as every creature in heaven and earth and hell will be made to acknowledge Revelation 513The first preaching unit ends with JEs statement I intend God allowing and assisting at another opportunity to show that God is most reasonable towards men in his covenants in his commands and in his providence towards them in this world MS pp 2527 are taken up with a recapitulation of the doctrine main propositions and a rehearsal of the points covered thus far and so the passage is omitted

Doctrine Resumed
We now proceed to the third thing proposed which was to show that

III God is most reasonable in the covenants that he has made with man And in the

First place with respect to the covenant of works we shall speak to but one particular and that is in making the covenant with one common head for all so that the breaking of the covenant by that common head should be imputed to all the rest This is that particularMS this a partie that Particular in this covenant that the corrupt mind of man is most apt to quarrel and find fault with It is a stumbling block to them that God should make a covenant with Adam for his posterity that were not yet born so that what he did should be imputed to them as if they had done it and that they should be held guilty upon that account and should suffer for it though they were not then in the world when the thing was done But we shall endeavor to clear up the fairness and reasonableness of this by the following reasons

1 From what we have said already tis evident that tis no way unjust or unreasonable for God to decree and appoint that all mankind should fall and become guilty We have already proved that tis not an unfair thing in God to appoint sin so to appoint that it should certainly be done and to withhold that grace without which sin will certainly follow and that the sinner is not at all excused by it And if it be so it follows that it would be no injustice in God to decree and appoint sin and guilt and so punishment in every one of mankind Now this was indeed the decree of God that all mankind should fall and be guilty before him and as we have proved his righteous and reasonable decree therefore there is no objection lies against this that God should so order it that all men should fall but only that he should fall in such a way in our common head and representative Therefore we go on

2 If he had fallen by his own act it would not have been at all the better for him His guilt is not greater because Adams sin is imputed to him than if he by his own act had done as Adam did and in the same manner broken Gods covenant The degree of guilt that he should have was what Gods eternal decree had determined And if he had had the same degree of guilt another way it would have been equally to his detriment

3 There would have been every whit as much danger of falling if God had made a covenant with every person in particular If God had created us with the same strength and wisdom and the same original righteousness and had afforded the same grace and assistance and no more there would have been altogether as much danger of any other particular person of mankinds falling as there was of Adams

If Adam had stood then all his posterity would certainly have had eternal life there would have been no danger of missing of it And if Adam had stood only on his own account and obtained eternal life only for himself and we had been set upon trial for ourselves and had failed then it would have been as much to our hurt and misery that the covenant was not made with Adam for us as it can possibly now be that it was

Gods thus ordering the covenant tended as much to our good as our hurt and as much to our good as the making of it distinctly with everyone for if Adam had remained in innocency then we should have had eternal life as the fruits of it and that would have been as great a good as eternal death which the fall has merited for Adam and all his posterity is an evil And therefore

4 It could not be beyond the authority and right of God the absolute sovereign of all things to determine this matter whether the covenant should be made with one common head for all or with everyone in particular for themselves He that made us for his own glory and in whom we live move and have our being and wholly depend upon in everything certainly might order that matter according as he pleased And he doth no injustice when he made the covenant with our common father for us all especially when in

5 The fifth place it was a very suitable thing that seeing we were all naturally in Adam that we should be also in him federally that seeing we were in him in the order of nature that God had appointed we should also be in him with respect to the covenant Tis only because his sovereignty so ordered it that we derive from him our natural beings and the same sovereignty might as well so order it that we should also derive from him our moral beings We derive from him according to the order of nature our understandings our wills and all our natural powers it was therefore suitable that we should also derive from him the moral qualifications of these understandings and wills original righteousness or original sin according as he stands or fallsJE filled only about one third of MS p 32 reason 6 begins at the top of the next page

6 This way of acting is by the practice of all nations allowed to be reasonable in civil affairs If a man by committing treason or any other great crime has his goods confiscated forfeits his estate his posterity forfeits it with him Children unborn suffer by it as his children are looked upon as the heirs of his fortunes so also of his misfortunes So Adam by his treason and rebellion against his Maker he forfeited both Gods image and favor which he had received not as any personal good peculiar to himself but as a common good that was to be transmitted to his posterity if he had remained in his integrity And therefore when he forfeited them his posterity also forfeited for how can they be heirs of that from him which he had not For he was deprived both of original righteousness and of Gods favor and in them all mankind who were contained in him forfeited it likewise

So it is in covenants that are made between one nation and another Supposing it be a treaty of peace or alliance what the head and representatives of those nations agree upon all that belong to those nations are obliged by though they never had any hand in it and not only they but their posterity that had no being when the covenant was made yea though it may be very much to their disadvantage And many other practices of the like kind obtain in the world that are agreeable to the laws of nations and therefore the light of nature which shows that tis not an unreasonable thing that a covenant should be made with a common head and representative for all the rest and with parents for posterity

Not that what God doth needs any arguments fetched from the practice of the world to prove the reasonableness of it for to say that God doth it is an argument of infinitely greater authority to prove that is right than to say that its agreeable to the practice of all ages and nations in the whole world But yet such arguments may serve to convince men seeing they are taken from those things that they themselves practice and allow in other cases

Use
Let us make this use of what has now been proved

I If it be so that God deals most reasonably with us in imputing of Adams sin to us then let us bewail and humble ourselves for our fall and for that guilt and corruption of nature that is thereby brought upon us When Adam had broken Gods covenant God took away his Spirit from him and thereby took away his image and he became destitute of original righteousness and his soul universally corrupted And also for the same reason doth God deny his Spirit and image to all Adams posterity because they broke the covenant in Adam God therefore denies his image and grace to them and their hearts thereby become full of sin This original corruption is both our punishment and our sin and upon both accounts therefore have we reason to humble and abase ourselves before him

Let us therefore bewail both that transgression that brought our corruption of nature and also this corruption of nature itself And dont cavil and say that it was none of your fault that Adam sinned for you wont then in being so but own Gods righteous judgments and humble yourself under them abase yourself for the vile and needless and foolish apostasy of our first parents and yours in them and that wickedness of heart that thereby you have contracted and own as Daniel that righteousness belongs to God but to you confusion of face Daniel 97

II If it be so that God deals most reasonably with us when he holds us guilty for the transgression of our first parents let everyone see and own his necessity of a Savior in that every one of the children of Adam have sinned in him and do justly deserve death yea eternal death for that sin Romans 512 Wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin and so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned If it were for nothing but this that we have sinned and rebelled in Adam it would be enough forever to render vain and good for nothing all our own righteousness If we could weep an ocean of tears it would not be sufficient to satisfy only for that sin And if we could perform perfect obedienceas perfect as that that the first covenant required or as the holy angels in heaven performit would in no measure satisfy the justice of God for that sin and we should nevertheless stand in necessity of a Savior

And if so how far are we from being able to work out a righteousness of our own that will be accepted after thousands of repeated acts of sin and rebellion after our sins are become more in number than the hairs of our heads and are become like the great mountains after a long time of serving Satan and a continued living in disobedience to God What a vain imagination is it to think that after all we can make ourselves so righteous that we shall render ourselves the objects of Gods favor Let none therefore entertain so foolish and unreasonable a thought but own that you are in a condemned state and justly condemned till you embrace Jesus Christ as your Redeemer

III Let us the more admire Gods grace and condescension in his readiness to make a second covenant with us and so impute unto us the righteousness of a second Adam notwithstanding all the aggravations that this breach of covenant was attended with in that we changed the favor of God for so small a matter as the taste of an apple that we rebelled against God that had been so bountiful to us and familiarly made himself known to us and given us all the enjoyments of paradise and that we hearkened to the counsel of the devil who told man of being like God rather than to obey Gods commands

Yet God presently revealed another and a better covenant gave us another federal head another Adam that could not fail but would certainly bring in everlasting righteousness and stands ready to impute unto us his righteousness though the sin of the first Adam is justly imputed and God might reasonably exact all the debt of us that we contracted in him

Twas a gracious and condescending act in God to make the first covenant with men that the Almighty should enter into covenant with worms But here is a more wonderful act of grace and condescension in that after we had broken this covenant and had rebelled against him and had become enemies God freely gave us another covenant a better covenant being committed to better hands into the hands of a surety that cant fail of doing what the first Adam failed of Surely this deserves our greatest admiration and praise

But instead of that there are some that will find fault even with the covenant of grace and quarrel with that that is the most glorious dispensation of grace and mercy that ever was given to the world such as is admirable in the eyes of angels for the glorious riches of goodness and grace that appear in it The heart of man is in its natural state at such enmity with God that theres scarcely any of Gods dealings however holy and however gracious but what it will find fault with

Doctrine Resumed
We therefore now proceed in the

Second place to vindicate the covenant of grace and shall only speak this one objection that is made against the reasonableness of it viz

Obj That God has made that the condition of it which is not in our own power

God requires of us faith in Jesus Christ that we should come to him for salvation that we should accept of him as our Savior and receive him into our hearts who is come into the world to redeem us This is all that God requires of us and what less could be required of us in order to our being saved by Christ than that we should heartily accept of him for our Savior that we should consent to the way of salvation proposed in the gospel in order to the being saved in that way But yet sinners do object this against the goodness and grace of God in requiring of this condition that it is out of their power They are not able to believe But these following considerations are sufficient to make them ashamed of their finding fault with God on this account

1 Tis a wonder that God offers men any condition of salvation at all and that he dont damn them without any condition Tis mere and wonderful grace that there is so much as a bare possibility of our being saved that we bent left as much without hope as the devils in hell God was under no obligation to propose any terms to us We had made ourselves enemies and warcaptives to his justice and if he had cast us down to hell and bound us in chains of darkness to the judgment of the great day he therein might have glorified his justice and have been praised by the angels forever for his righteous judgments Therefore it dont become us to find fault with the terms of mercy for we have reason to admire that we bent already in hell Lamentations 322 Tis of the Lords mercies that we are not consumed and because his compassions fail not

2 Mans being not able to believe in Christ is an inability that arises from sin This impotency dont primitively belong to mans nature man was not created at first so impotent But tis this sinfulness and the perverseness of their hearts that renders them unable Otherwise twould be an easy thing to accept of a Savior to come to him for salvationas easy as it is to eat or drink or breath If it were not for a baseness of spirit it would be no difficult thing for men to love one that is so beautiful and excellent and one that has done so much to win the heart of man They could not help loving highly esteeming and admiring of him

Wherefore dont let us lay the blame of our inability to come to Christ upon God but upon ourselves who have made ourselves so base and perverse that we can do no other than reject that lovely Person whom God himself infinitely loved from all eternity

3 Men bent condemned for not being able but for not being willing to accept of Christ Men indeed in a natural state and condition are dead and so unable to perform any spiritual act they are utterly unable to believe in Christ without Gods giving life to them

But however neither are they willing Their wills and inclinations are opposite to the nature and person of the Mediator and also to his way of salvation and the reason why they dont come is because they bent inclined and because they will not Their unbelief is a willful refusing and rejecting of Christ John 540 Ye will not come unto me that ye may have life

And this is what they are condemned for Let no man object against the condition of the covenant of grace that he is not able to perform it till he finds himself willing to do it and yet not able for when once he is willing hell have no reason to complain that he is not able

Use

Hence we learn the unreasonableness of those who refuse the covenant of grace In every covenant there is required the consent of both parties in the first covenant it was required of Adam that he should accept and consent on his part to the covenant proposed by God but after he had consented he was yet to do that work which was the condition of the covenant he had yet to perform perfect obedience But this covenant being broke God proposes a second covenant to us for eternal life and in this covenant there is nothing to do but only to consent there is no work to be done afterwards as the condition of it the work is done by Christ All that we have to do in order to have the blessings of the covenant is to consent to the covenant and in our hearts to approve and accept of it and of the Mediator that has done the work so reasonable so gracious a way of salvation has God offered to sinners after their breach of the first covenant

How unreasonable therefore are they that refuse this way that had rather continue at odds with God and Christ though they perish than to accept of this proposal Let sinners therefore know that they act very unreasonably in that they dont believe in Jesus Christ As the covenant proposed in him is the most reasonable and gracious that can be conceived of so refusing of it is the most unreasonable thing in the world

Doctrine Resumed
We are come now to the fourth thing that was proposed and that was to show

IV That God is most reasonable with men in his commands And that will appear by these things following

First His absolute right unto us and sovereignty over us makes it most reasonable that we should obey whatever he commands Tis reasonable that God should prescribe how we shall serve him for he brought us out of nothing for this end that we might serve him and he keeps us from dropping into nothing every moment All the being we have and all the good of that being is from him It therefore belongs to him to give us what rules and laws he pleases for our answering his own ends which he proposed in giving us our beings And it belongs to us to obey without disputing or saying to him What dost thou for the great God is not accountable to worms It belongs to us to obey without hesitating and complaining whatever labor or expense he requires whatever difficulties he requires us to go through whatever pains and troubles he requires us to bear how much soever he requires us to deny ourselves If he should require us to cut off a right hand or pluck out a right eye or to offer a dear and only son it would belong to us readily to obey as Abraham did without saying why so for that is certainly just and right towards that sovereign Being in whom we live move and have our being Tis reason enough without anything else that he that commands is Jehovah We find this very frequently set at the end of Gods precepts to enforce obedience to them Leviticus 1856 Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and judgments   I am the Lord None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him to uncover their nakedness I am the Lord And Leviticus 1821 And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire unto Molech neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God I am the Lord And Numbers 313 The firstborn of both man and beast shall be mine I am the Lord

Second Gods commands are in themselves considered most just and equitable What can be more reasonable than that we should with all our hearts love and fear and adore him who is an infinitely perfect and glorious Being and who is our creator and Father and our constant preserver What can be more reasonable than that we should joyfully and thankfully praise him from whom we receive every good thing that we enjoy and who is every day doing of us good

What can be more reasonable than that we should make him the highest end of our lives who has given us our lives and that we should subject every affair to his service and glory who has given us powers of acting and without whom we are not able to move or speak a word or think a thought

And what can be more reasonable than that we should devote a seventh part of our time to be spent more especially in Gods service in the duties of his worship and adoration and in those exercises that do more especially relate to our spiritual part and our eternal state

What can be more reasonable than that we should love our neighbors as ourselves and do by them as we would have them in like circumstances do by us and live in the exercise of justice and equity charity and faithfulness towards our fellow creatures that have the same nature as we ourselves Or that we should be obliged to live in the exercise of temperance and sobriety and patience in the use of the good things God bestows upon us and under those providences that we are the subjects of What can be more equal and just than those laws and rules of the Most High Surely Gods commands are purer than gold tried in the fire Psalms 1979 The law of the Lord is perfect the testimony of the Lord is sure The statutes of the Lord are right the commandment of the Lord is pure The fear of the Lord is clean the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether And Psalms 119128 I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right

Third Those things that we are required to do in their own nature tend to our own benefit and happiness The duties of fear love and trust in God do in their own nature exceedingly tend to the spiritual peace and comfort of the soul and tend most of anything to the comfort and quiet of the mind in the changes and troubles of this world So all the duties and exercises of justice and charity and brotherly kindness towards our neighbors and brethren tend exceedingly to the welfare of human society The further the world is from these the more is earth like hell not only for wickedness but for confusion and trouble and the more of them there is practiced the more is it like heaven

So the duties of temperance and sobriety and chastity tend very much to the health of both mind and body And in short holiness is a mans highest happiness and sin his greatest misery There is nothing else but holiness can give the mind true peace and joy and nothing so much disturbs and disorders and troubles the soul and lays a foundation for so much uneasiness and torment as sin

Surely therefore Gods commands are most reasonable seeing he requires nothing but what of its own nature tends to our own good Psalms 1911 In the keeping thy commandments there is a great reward

Fourth All the difficulty there is in any of Gods commands arises from the sinfulness of mens own hearts From thence it is that there is any difficulty in prayer or meditation or reading the holy Scriptures or keeping the sabbath or attending to the Word preached or in a suitable attendance on ordinances

Tis from sin that there is any difficulty in fearing or loving or praising or trusting in God or that there is any difficulty in being patient and humble or temperate or in being peaceable and charitable and forgiving towards our neighbors There would not be the least difficulty in these things if it were not for the sinful disposition that there is in the heart The heart is so corrupt that these things are indeed now sometimes like the cutting off of a right hand or plucking out a right eye but there is no difficulty at all in the things themselves but it is a perverse heart that makes them difficult If it were not for that it would not only not be difficult to do these duties but very pleasant and delightful it would be a great pleasure to do them Matthew 1130 My yoke is easy and my burthen light Proverbs 317 Wisdoms ways are ways of pleasantness and all her paths are peace Therefore none can complain of Gods commands as being difficult seeing that in themselves they are not only easy but exceeding pleasant and all the difficulty there is in them arises from mens own sinful inclinations

Fifth God dont require us to serve him for naught Besides the natural tendency that Gods commands have to our good and though they are not at all difficult but pleasant in themselves and though God justly if he pleases requires the hardest labor and undergoing the greatest difficulties without any reward yet he has promised an exceeding great reward a crown of glory an eternal kingdom and everlasting blessedness to all that sincerely and faithfully observe his commands Therefore tis exceeding evident that God is most reasonable in his commandments

Inference

We shall only draw one inference from this particular to wit that sin is of an exceeding evil and odious nature being disobedience to so holy and reasonable commands of God Disobedience would be a very great and infinitely aggravated evil if it were to commands that no had no natural tendency to our good and if they were in themselves very difficult to perform and we were to have no reward for obeying them but especially is it exceeding hateful and unreasonable when thereby these commands of the great and holy God are broken that are contrived for our own good and that are in themselves so easy and delightful in the performance that in their own nature are so just and equitable To disobey such commands of our maker and preserver and gracious benefactor may well stir up the wrath and fury of almighty God We shall refer the consideration of the reasonableness of Gods punishments and common providence to another opportunity

Doctrine Resumed
We now proceed in the

V Fifth place to show that God is most reasonable in his punishments All the particulars that have hitherto been mentioned show that tis a most reasonable thing in God to execute his wrath against sin It follows from the first particular wherein we showed that Gods appointment and permission of sin no way excused the sinner that he did not at all the less deserve punishment for that We also showed that it was a just thing in God to choose some to eternal life and leave others to perish in their sin And Gods being reasonable in his covenant of works shows that God may justly hold the sinner to that covenant and execute the curses of that covenant upon him especially when they reject the second covenant and the offers of mercy through a second Adam and refuse so reasonable and wonderfully gracious terms of this covenant And the reasonableness of Gods commands shows the great evil of sin and that disobedience to such commands merits a very severe punishment

But there are some that nevertheless have thought it hard that sin should be punished forever that there should be no end to that misery that they suffer Therefore we shall endeavor particularly to show that God deals most reasonably and justly in punishing sin eternally in making the sinner everlastingly miserable so that he shall never have done suffering to execute his fiery wrath upon him and make him exceeding miserable so that there shall be no hope nor any possibility of its ever being better with him so that there should be no possible escape either by getting out of Gods reach and hiding from him or by working upon his mercy and persuading him to pity them or by being delivered by anyone else that will take their part and defend them or by dying and turning to nothing or by being turned into a beast or by supporting and strengthening their hearts under their punishment so as to bear it with resolution I say tis most just and reasonable with God so to punish sin and execute his wrath upon the sinner so that there should be no possibility of his being helped any of these ways but so that he must needs suffer the dreadful wrath of God one age afterMS of another one thousand of years after another forever and ever And this will appear by the following considerations

First Sin tends in its own nature to bring everlasting misery upon the soul Eternal death is not only the wages but the proper fruit and natural produce of sin that is sin brings the soul into such a condition so destroys and ruins the nature so corrupts and poisons the heart that the soul never can recover itself It so kills the soul that it never to all eternity can restore itself or anyway procure any restoration for itself It so infects the mind and brings such a distemper upon it that it never will of itself grow well of that it never can cure itself of and that no creature can cure

And the health and life of the soul being forever ruined it necessarily becomes everlastingly miserable for pain and misery is the natural fruit of this poison The constitution of the soul being forever corrupted there unavoidably follows pain and sorrow which will be in the soul as long as the soul remains thus corrupted but it never being able to recover itself from this corruption it follows that it will be forever miserable God is the fountain of happiness and to be separated from him is the greatest misery But by sin man has drove away God from the soul and therefore must be miserable forever if God returns not

Sin as naturally makes the soul miserable as poison doth the body and the reason why the souls of sinners bent always in torment in this world is because their souls are as it were benumbed and kept asleep by the body The flesh that they carry about with them keeps them in a stupid condition like a person in a lethargy but when they awake in another world it will be otherwise

They are diverted here by their senses by innumerable cares and sensual pleasures Multitudes of objects present themselves to their senses that are like opium to them

But when their souls come to be naked in another world it will be quite a different case When God and separate spirits are the only objects that will be presented before them then theyll feel the painful operation of sin then this poison will work and theyll feel that sin is misery Eternal misery therefore is the proper and reasonable punishment of sin inasmuch as it is the natural fruit of it Proverbs 836 He that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul all they that hate me love death Sin is a root whose natural fruit is gall and wormwood Deuteronomy 2918

Second Sin is an affront and injury to an infinite majesty and therefore merits an eternal punishment If an injury to a finite person deserves finite punishment it will follow that an offense to an infinite person or being deserves infinite punishment If an injury is aggravated at all in any proportion whatsoever by the degree merit and excellency of the person injured it will most surely follow that that offense that is committed against one of infinite excellency is infinitely aggravated

It is certain and without dispute that if an injury to an excellent person deserves punishment and an injury to a more excellent person deserves a greater punishmentand for that reason because he is more excellent and deservingthen an injury and abuse to one of infinite excellency and glory deserves an infinitely greater punishment than any injury to a finite person for that reason because he is a being of infinitely greater excellency The consequence certainly is very clear

God is a Being of infinite greatness of boundless might and wisdom and sin is infinitely aggravated upon that account and he is a Being of infinite holiness and goodness of infinite amiableness and excellency and sin is infinitely aggravated upon that account Now punishment cant be infinite in the degree of pain and misery because a finite creature is not capable of it Therefore tis infinite in its continuance

If we were but sensible of the majesty of God and saw how great and glorious he is we should not think it at all hard that he that sins against him should be tormented without hope forever and ever To disobey and affront God would look like so dreadful a thing and sin would appear so aggravated an evil that we should think it a most just and reasonable thing that the sinner should suffer forever for it

That is the reason that the saints in heaven so praise God for the punishment of the wicked because they are sensible of the majesty and glory of God and they see how just it is that those that have affronted him and cast contempt upon him should suffer everlasting burnings for it Revelation 1913 And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven saying Alleluia Salvation and glory and honor and power unto the Lord our God for true and righteous are his judgments for he hath judged the great whore which did corrupt the earth with her fornication and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand And again they said Alleluia And her smoke rose up for ever and ever

Third Sin is disobedience to infinite authority and therefore deserves eternal punishment Sin is an infinite evil upon these two accounts both because tis committed against one in himself infinitely excellent and deserving of the contrary and because tis committed against him that has an absolute sovereignty over us and over all creatures His authority is so great that the greatest princes and monarchs are as much subject to him as the meanest person and so are the thrones and dominions principalities and powers in heaven and so they would be if they were a thousand times greater and mightier than they are they would be as absolutely subject to the authority and dominion of God and his authority over them would be as great as over the meanest and lowest of his servants He has an infinite supremacy over and right to his creatures and their obligations to subjection to him are infinitely strong

And therefore when Gods authority is slighted and his dominion rejected and the creature rebels he commits an infinite evil and so deserves punishment that hath no end

Direct disobedience to the commands of a king deserves greater punishment than disobedience to an inferior magistrate because a king is a person of greater authority So disobedience to the great God deserves infinitely greater punishment because he is a Being of infinitely greater authority 1 Samuel 225 If one man sin against another the judge shall judge him but if a man sin against the Lord who shall entreat for him

Fourth Tis becoming the infinite majesty of God that as his favor is infinitely desirable so his anger should be infinitely dreadful But except those that are the objects of his displeasure suffer eternally his displeasure is not infinitely dreadful If it were to have any end there would be some hope in it and men would not stand in such awe of God They would be abundantly more bold and less afraid of Gods anger and indeed it would be infinitely less to be feared than now it is inasmuch as any temporal punishment though it continues a great while is infinitely less than an eternal punishment

Gods favor is infinitely desirable because the fruit of it is an eternal good and benefit It is infinitely beneficial to the favorite as it is a becoming thing that the favor of a God should be So also with equal reason tis becoming of God that his anger should be infinitely prejudicial to them that obstinately sin against him

Fifth That which is reasonably threatened is reasonably executed but tis reasonable and even necessary to threaten no less than eternal punishment The threatening of a punishment that is to have an end would not awe men to obedience Such is the corruption of mans heart so great are his sinful inclinations and so hardhearted are sinners and set in ways of sin that a less punishment would not deter them it would not be sufficient so to terrify and awaken them so as to put a stop to their sinful courses If they were to be punished a thousand years or a million or however long yet if it were to have an end they would take encouragement that it would not last always that sometime or other it would be over and so they would be bold in sin

This is very evident in that though now eternal punishment is threatened it has so little effect upon men that they are so little awakened by it that thousands and millions nevertheless give themselves a full swing in iniquity and go on securely in a way of disobedience to God and its a difficult thing by telling men of everlasting burnings to make them bethink themselves and leave off a way of allowed sinning How would it be then if it were only a temporal punishment was threatened a punishment that is infinitely less dreadful than an eternal one as every temporal punishment is however long it is continued

Use

IIn revising for repreaching JE inserted the following at the beginning of the Use Hence the making offers of mercy are what God is not obliged to Hence the showing mercy upon desires and prayers To those that are afraid of being damned Let them see and own that it would be most just with God forever to cast them into hell Dont be inventing these and those excuses for yourselves dont meditate upon the good things you have done the care you have taken to avoid sin and the pains you have taken to do as God commands but own that God may justly cast you into hell forevermore notwithstanding all that you have done notwithstanding all your care and pains

Dont think with yourself that I had such strong temptation I was under such and such disadvantages to do my duty and I have been sorry for it since and it would be very hard if I should forever be made to lie in the fire of hell for that for if you had had such a sense of the infinite majesty and authority of God as you ought to have you would have had more care you would not have given way to those temptations you would have done your duty though it was under never so great disadvantages you would have done anything and suffered anything rather than have disobeyed the infinitely excellent and glorious God and the sovereign of heaven and earth

Men deserve eternal punishment for being so senseless of the greatness and majesty of God that they dare upon any account whatsoever sin against him Sinners however they excuse themselves yet tis certain that by their sin they have for a small matter affronted an infinite authority and sovereignty and cast contempt upon an infinite majesty Men bent sensible what it is when they know that such a thing is the express command of God to go wittingly and knowingly and do the contrary This is what no temptation in the world will excuse How can they expect any other than that by doing thus they shall provoke the wrath and vengeance of God

Wherefore cast yourself down at Gods feet come as with a rope about your neck and in no wise excuse yourself but own that you deserve nothing but an eternal hell

II Hence we learn then in another world when sinners are actually feeling the misery of hell and are despairing of ever being delivered from it they will have none to accuse but themselves The thoughts of their torments being everlasting without any end or respite will merely amaze them The thoughts of it will fill them with dreadful horror will sink their souls down into the very depths of the blackness of darkness but yet they will see that it is most just and righteous their consciences will tell them that they have deserved it Then their sin that they make so many excuses for in this world will be seen in its own proper horrible appearance to them They stifle their consciences in this world but they will not be able to stifle them then but they will accuse and curse themselves for their folly and madness in bringing such everlasting mischief upon themselves

We are come now in the

VI Sixth and last place to show that God is most reasonable in his providential dealings with them in this world

What has been said already is sufficient to show that God is reasonable in all the afflictions he brings If it be a reasonable thing that every sin should be punished with everlasting misery surely none has any reason at all to complain for those light afflictions which are suffered in this world which are infinitely less

If we are deprived of near relations and have one stroke after another yea if we should have bereavements to as great a degree as Job had and should also at the same time be bereaved of all our outward substance as he was and should have our bodies filled with pain and tormenting diseases from head to foot as his body was yet it would be nothing to hell which our iniquities have deserved

If we should be carried into captivity from our kindred and our country and were to spend our lives in the mines or in the galleys yea if we were roasted alive twould be nothing to that which we have in the last particular shown that sin deserves Lamentations 339 Wherefore doth the living man complain a man for the punishment of his sin

If it be objected that the sins of the righteous are satisfied for by Christ and are all pardoned for his sake and yet afflictions are brought upon them I answer they bent brought as proper punishments of sin but as chastisement A punishment is an evil but chastisements are good things It will be better for them in another world than if they had them not Afflictions bent proper punishment of sin but the remains of sin make it necessary that they should be brought upon the wicked and the goodConjecture for MS damage at the bottom of MS p 65 where only the tops of the words remain

But that particular in Gods providence which has been most of a stumbling block is that God sometimes suffers the wicked to be in great prosperity and brings sore and heavy calamities upon the righteous those that are his faithful servants

Sometimes a wicked man one that fears not God and lives in contempt of him fares sumptuously in a stately palace and sits at a table set with dainties and it may be a godly man one that sincerely obeys all Gods commands sits at his gate in rags A child of God sometimes shall be a slave and vassal to a child of the devil Such a man as Nero and Diocletian shall sit upon an imperial throne and thousands of Gods faithful witnesses shall be put to all manner of cruelty by him have all their substance taken away and their children taken away and killed before their eyes and they themselves it may be flayed alive or broken on the wheel or burnt at the stake

Men are ready to say If a just and righteous God governs the world how should things be thus How can this be a just and wise disposing of things To this I say

First that this world is not a godly mans portion That which he looked for and expected that which was his motive to forsake sin and yield himself to God was not worldly prosperity The promises that his faith was built upon and that were his encouragement did not respect a temporal but an eternal good Christ told his disciples that his kingdom was not of this world that here they must expect tribulation They that never gave themselves to God and to his service upon the encouragements of another world without any dependence upon this never gave themselves to him truly God dont make a distinction between the righteous and the wicked in this world by always giving the righteous earthly prosperity for that very end to lead their faith and their hearts into another world that they may not look at those things that are seen but at those that arent seen so that the godly man may live by faith and live above this world

Second The godly mans afflictions are better than a wicked mans prosperity It is better to be tried as gold though it be in the fire for a season and so to be purified and brightened and to shine in glory than it is to grow and flourish to be cast into unquenchable fire forever The chastening of children is better than the fatting of beasts for the slaughter It is better to go to heaven that is to be going there with but one eye or but one hand or foot and clothed with rags than to be going to hell with a body perfectly sound and clothed in gold and pearls

Third This state of things is but very short If it were always to be so that the wicked were to be in prosperity and the godly in adversity it would indeed be confusion but this will soon be regulated Tis so for a moment as it were but when the state of things comes to be fixed all things will be in their just order and harmony The afflictions of the godly are as nothing in comparison of that glory and blessedness which they will then be made partakers of and in comparison of that glory which shall be the blessed fruit of their afflictions 2 Corinthians 417 For our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory


Use

Let us therefore be exhorted to yield and resign ourselves to Gods providence patiently submit to whatever he is pleased to bring upon us in the world and be willing that he should dispose of us as he pleases seeing we know that all his providential dealings are most reasonable and we can be assured that God can do us no wrong

Tis very unreasonable to murmur and complain of those afflictions which we suffer in this world If we once had a sight of that hell that we have deserved and had a sense of that eternity through which the misery of hell is to continue instead of murmuring at those afflictions we suffer we should do nothing but praise and extol God that we bent in that place of torment

We shall conclude with a few words by way of General Application

We have now heard it particularly proved that God is very reasonable and just in all his dealings with men that all his ways are righteous and equal that there is no objection can lie against any of them that there is nothing in them contrary to an infinitely just and holy nature And therefore

I Hence we learn that those that refuse and rebel act very unreasonably Ezekiel 3317 Yet the children of thy people say The way of the Lord is not equal but as for them their way is not equal They that will not submit to the most just and reasonable government of the creator of the world their rebellion against God is wholly without grounds they can find no fault with his manner of governing the world they have no reasonable objection God challenges you to show any unfairness in any of his dealings Isaiah 4326 Put me in remembrance let us plead together declare thou that thou mayst be justified And Micah 623 Hear ye O mountains the Lords controversy and ye strong foundations of the earth for the Lord hath a controversy with his people and he will plead with Israel O my people what have I done unto thee and wherein have I wearied thee testify against me So may I say unto sinners What hath God done unto you that you depart from him and refuse subjection to him So Jeremiah 25 Thus saith the Lord What iniquity have your fathers found in me that they are gone far from me and have walked after vanity and are become vain

But that you may see more particularly how unreasonable they are that live in ways of sin against God consider the following things

First They use those things that are the gifts of God to them as weapons against him Those faculties of soul those powers of understanding and will which God has given them are devoted to sin those eyes those ears those tongues those hands and feet which God gave them they use as instruments of sin against God If God should take away from them their sight or hearing or their speech by striking of them dumb or their hands or feet they would think it a very great calamity but yet all the while they enjoy them they with them sin against God that gave them

So also they improve the gifts of his providence all in the service of sin The food and the raiment by which God from day to day supports them and whatever God gives them it is all improved against him who bestows them Is not this very unreasonable Hosea 28 For she did not know that I gave her corn and wine and oil and multiplied her silver and gold which they prepared for Baal

Second They return God evil for good They receive abundance of kindness from God a thousand times more than from any man God every day is bestowing good things upon them but for his love they are his enemies God is in his dealings to them as a father and they are to him as enemies Isaiah 12 Hear O heavens and give ear O earth for the Lord hath spoken I have nourished and brought up children and they have rebelled against me Herein they show themselves more ungrateful than the beasts for oxen and horses and dogs will seem to show a gratitude to their masters for their kindness See the third verse The ox knows his owner and the ass his masters crib but Israel doth not know my people do not consider

God bestows upon them outward mercies and tis them that they live upon every day And he bestows upon them spiritual mercies in using means with them for their salvation gives them his Word and his sacraments offers a Savior to them and sets heaven doors open to them and all does but harden their hearts in sin against him who bestows these things upon them Isaiah 54 What could have been done more to my vineyard that I have not done in it wherefore when I looked that it should bring forth grapes brought it forth wild grapes

This is to treat God so as a man would be hated for for treating one of his fellow creatures

Third They refuse either to be commanded or counseled or entreated to be awed by threatenings or drawn by mercies and promises So unreasonable are they that nothing will do with them They dont regard Gods authority and his strict commandments and when he like a father counsels them they will not hearken When he threatens them they are not afraid of his wrath and when he promises heaven and eternal blessedness they dont regard his promises They will not be persuaded anyway that can be used to be willing and obedient

But they regard neither authority nor kindness neither the will of God nor their own interest They can be neither drawn nor driven How unreasonably therefore do such act

Use II Whenever we have any objection arising in our own minds against any of Gods dealings let us learn to subject our reason to God and depend on his faithfulness Consider

First This is the only way to have peace in our minds While the heart quarrels with God tis not likely that there will be any peace or quietness in it Such an one is all surrounded with briars and thorns If we contend with God and are quarreling with the mysteries of religion he will leave us to be more and more in the dark we shall find nothing but confusion and mischief If we lean to our own understanding God will leave us to it and we shall soon be led away from the plain path into a dreadful wilderness which we shall find no way out of The devil loves to have to do with such souls as are a caviling and quarreling with God he sets them on and helps forward their carnal reasonings and God suffers him so to do

Second Those that contend with God must expect that he will contend with themSee the sermon on Psalms 1826 111 preached in the latter half of 1729 the doctrine of which is They that contend with God can expect no other than that God will contend with them They can expect no other than that God will fight against them in his providence for it is not a thing a little provoking to the Most High to have his justice called in question They that sow the wind shall reap the whirlwind Hosea 87

Use III If God in all his dealings with us be most reasonable then let us give God the glory that belongs to him on that account There is very much of this glory of God appearing to a sanctified eye in those of Gods dispensations that sinners are so apt to quarrel with Yea some of those things which are most contended with are what would appear most glorious to us if we viewed things aright especially the eternal decrees of God in electing a certain separate number to eternal life These things are what the saints and angels will forever praise God for in heaven as in the sixteenth chapter of Revelation at the seventh verse

The reasonableness of God in his dealings with men consists in these three things first in their being perfectly agreeable to justice and righteousness and second their being according to perfect wisdom and third their not being anyway inconsistent with perfect goodness Let us therefore praise God for his justice and faithfulness and say with the heavenly hosts Revelation 1912 Salvation and glory and honor and power unto the Lord our God for true and righteous are his judgments There is no catchword at the corner yet it is possible that one or more leaves are missing at the end of the sermon
